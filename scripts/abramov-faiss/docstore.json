This was probably the happiest day of my life. For the first time, I put faces next to avatars. There were UI nerds and my personal heroes around me. It felt like going to Hogwarts.\nMy talk almost didn’t happen. In the morning, I found that my laptop refused to connect to the projector. I only had a few hours left. Christopher Chedeau was kind enough to lend me his laptop, and I transferred my live demo setup to his computer (except for the Sublime license, as you may know if you watched it).","metadata":{"source":"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/abramov.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":86,"to":88}}}}],["d18890a0-e5c4-4f2a-b23e-768da4f1b39d",{"pageContent":"At first, my demo didn’t run on Christopher’s laptop because we had different Node versions.

I remembered her from our IRC chat on the React channel, and came to say hi. She asked whether FB recruiters contacted me before, and I said I couldn’t get a US visa. Jing asked whether I’m interested in working at the London office, and I had no idea there even was a London office! I called my wife and asked if she’s up for moving to London.
