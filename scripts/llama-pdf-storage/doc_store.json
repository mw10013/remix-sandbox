To Lauren, my partner, my muse, and my greatest inspiration in\\neverything I do\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThe Promise of a Second Brain\\nHow  often  have  you  tried  to  remember  something  important  and  felt  it  slip\\nthrough your mental grasp? Perhaps  you  were  having  a  conversation  and  couldn’t  remember  a  fact  that\\nwould have convincingly supported your point of view. Maybe you conceived of\\na brilliant new idea while driving or in transit, but by the time you arrived at your\\ndestination, it had evaporated. How often have you struggled to recall even one\\nuseful takeaway from a book or article you read in the past? As the amount of information we have access to grows, such experiences are\\nbecoming more and more common. We’re flooded with more advice than ever\\npromising to make us smarter, healthier, and happier. We consume more books,\\npodcasts, articles, and videos than we could possibly absorb. What do we really\\nhave to show for all the knowledge we’ve gained? How many of the great ideas\\nwe’ve  had  or  encountered  have  faded  from  our  minds  before  we  even  had  a\\nchance to put them into practice? We spend countless hours reading, listening to, and watching other people’s\\nopinions about what we should do, how we should think, and how we should\\nlive, but make comparatively little effort applying that knowledge and making it\\nour own. So much of the time we are “information hoarders,” stockpiling endless\\namounts of well-intentioned content that only ends up increasing our anxiety. This book is dedicated to changing that. You see, all the content you consume\\nonline and through all the different kinds of media you have at your disposal isn’t\\nuseless. It’s incredibly important and valuable. The only problem is that you’re\\noften consuming it at the wrong time. What are the chances that the business book you’re reading is exactly what you\\nneed  right  at  this  moment? What  are  the  odds  that  every  single  insight  from  a\\npodcast interview is immediately actionable? How many of the emails sitting in\\nyour inbox actually require your full attention right now? More likely, some of it\\nwill be relevant now, but most of it will become relevant only at some point in the\\nfuture. To be able to make use of information we value, we need a way to package it\\nup and send it through time to our future self. We need a way to cultivate a body\\nof knowledge that is uniquely our own, so when the opportunity arises—whether\\nchanging jobs, giving a big presentation, launching a new product, or starting a\\nbusiness or a family—we will have access to the wisdom we need to make good\\ndecisions and take the most effective action. It all begins with the simple act of\\nwriting things down. I’ll show you how this simple habit is the first step in a system I’ve developed\\ncalled Building a Second Brain, which draws on recent advancements in the field\\nof PKM—or personal knowledge management. I\\n In the same way that personal\\ncomputers  revolutionized  our relationship  with  technology,  personal  finance\\nchanged how we manage our money, and personal productivity reshaped how we\\nwork, personal knowledge management helps us harness the full potential of what\\nwe  know. While  innovations  in  technology  and  a  new  generation  of  powerful\\napps  have  created  new  opportunities  for  our  times,  the  lessons  you  will  find\\nwithin these pages are built on timeless and unchanging principles. The Building a Second Brain system will teach you how to:\\nFind anything you’ve learned, touched, or thought about in the past within\\nseconds. Organize  your  knowledge  and  use  it  to  move  your  projects  and  goals\\nforward more consistently.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f77df725-3107-42a9-b54c-0a4fca4593ac":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f77df725-3107-42a9-b54c-0a4fca4593ac\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"486e6831-88b6-482a-ae62-9b5f900daa9a\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"b8fa6d1b-c64b-4388-8700-5a2dccda61f7\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Save your best thinking so you don’t have to do it again.

In  this  book  I  will  teach  you  how  to  create  a  system  of  knowledge\\nmanagement, or a “Second Brain.” III\\n Whether you call it a “personal cloud,” “field\\nnotes,” or an “external brain” as some of my students have done, it is a digital\\narchive  of  your  most  valuable  memories,  ideas,  and  knowledge  to  help  you  do\\nyour job, run your business, and manage your life without having to keep every\\ndetail in your head. Like a personal library in your pocket, a Second Brain enables\\nyou to recall everything you might want to remember so you can achieve anything\\nyou desire. I’ve come to believe that personal knowledge management is one of the most\\nfundamental challenges—as well as one of the most incredible opportunities—in\\nthe world today. Everyone is in desperate need of a system to manage the ever-\\nincreasing volume of information pouring into their brains. I’ve heard the plea\\nfrom students and executives, entrepreneurs and managers, engineers and writers,\\nand so many others seeking a more productive and empowered relationship with\\nthe information they consume. Those  who  learn  how  to  leverage  technology  and  master  the  flow  of\\ninformation through their lives will be empowered to accomplish anything they\\nset their minds to. At the same time, those who continue to rely on their fragile\\nbiological brains will become ever more overwhelmed by the explosive growth in\\nthe complexity of our lives. I’ve spent years studying how prolific writers, artists, and thinkers of the past\\nmanaged their creative process. I’ve spent countless hours researching how human\\nbeings can use technology to extend and enhance our natural cognitive abilities. I’ve personally experimented with every tool, trick, and technique available today\\nfor  making  sense  of  information. This  book  distills  the  very  best  insights  I’ve\\ndiscovered from teaching thousands of people around the world how to realize\\nthe potential of their ideas. With  a  Second  Brain  at  your  fingertips,  you  will  be  able  to  unlock  the  full\\npotential of your hidden strengths and creative instincts. You will have a system\\nthat supports you when you are forgetful and unleashes you when you are strong. You will be able to do and learn and create so much more, with so much less effort\\nand stress, than was ever possible before. In the next chapter, I’ll tell you the story of how I built my own Second Brain,\\nand the lessons I learned along the way about how you can build one for yourself. I. The field of PKM emerged in the 1990s to help university students handle the huge volume of information\\nthey  suddenly  had  access  to  through  Internet-connected  libraries. It  is  the  individual  counterpart  to\\nKnowledge  Management,  which  studies  how  companies  and  other  organizations  make  use  of  their\\nknowledge. II. This metaphor was first used by Steve Jobs to describe the future potential of the personal computer. III. Other popular terms for such a system include Zettelkasten (meaning “slip box” in German, coined by\\ninfluential sociologist Niklas Luhmann), Memex (a word invented by American inventor Vannevar Bush),\\nand digital garden (named by popular online creator Anne-Laure Le Cunff).\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b8fa6d1b-c64b-4388-8700-5a2dccda61f7":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b8fa6d1b-c64b-4388-8700-5a2dccda61f7\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"f77df725-3107-42a9-b54c-0a4fca4593ac\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"17e6c71f-6b7b-416c-acd0-62e3c2593c01\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"PART ONE\\nThe Foundation\\nUnderstanding What’s Possible\\n\\nChapter 1\\nWhere It All Started\\nYour mind is for having ideas, not holding them. —David Allen, author of Getting Things Done\\nOne spring day during my junior year of college, for no apparent reason, I began\\nto feel a small pain in the back of my throat. I thought it was the first sign of a flu coming on, but my doctor couldn’t find a\\ntrace of illness. It slowly got worse over the next few months, and I began to visit\\nother, more specialized doctors. They all arrived at the same conclusion: there’s\\nnothing wrong with you. Yet  my  pain  continued  getting  worse  and  worse,  with  no  remedy  in  sight. Eventually  it  became  so  severe  that  I  had  trouble  speaking  or  swallowing  or\\nlaughing. I did every diagnostic test and scan imaginable, desperately looking for\\nanswers for why I was feeling this way. As months and then years passed, I began to lose hope that I would ever find\\nrelief. I started taking a powerful anti-seizure medication that temporarily relieved\\nthe  pain,  but  there  were  terrible  side  effects,  including  a  numbing  sensation\\nthroughout  my  body  and  severe  short-term  memory  loss. Entire  trips  I  took,\\nbooks I read, and precious experiences with loved ones during this period were\\nwiped from my memory as if they never happened. I was a twenty-four-year-old\\nwith the mind of an eighty-year-old. As my ability to express myself continued to deteriorate, my discouragement\\nturned to despair. Without the ability to speak freely, so much of what life had to\\noffer—friendships, dating, traveling, and finding a career I was passionate about\\n—seemed like it was slipping away from me. It felt like a dark curtain was being\\n\\ndrawn  over  the  stage  of  my  life  before  I  even  had  a  chance  to  start  my\\nperformance. A Personal Turning Point—Discovering the Power of Writing\\nThings Down\\nOne day, sitting in yet another doctor’s office waiting for yet another visit, I had\\nan epiphany. I realized in a flash that I was at a crossroads. I could either take\\nresponsibility for my own health and my own treatment from that day forward,\\nor I would spend the rest of my life shuttling back and forth between doctors\\nwithout ever finding resolution. I took out my journal and began to write what I was feeling and thinking. I\\nwrote  out  the  history  of  my  condition,  through  my  own  lens  and  in  my  own\\nwords, for the first time. I listed which treatments had helped and which hadn’t. I\\nwrote down what I wanted and didn’t want, what I was willing to sacrifice and\\nwhat I wasn’t, and what it would mean to me to escape the world of pain I felt\\ntrapped within. As  the  story  of  my  health  began  to  take  shape  on  the  page,  I  knew  what  I\\nneeded to do. I stood up abruptly, walked over to the receptionist, and asked for\\nmy complete patient record. She looked at me quizzically, but after I answered a\\nfew questions, she turned to her files and began making photocopies. My patient record amounted to hundreds of pages, and I knew I would never\\nbe  able  to  keep  track  of  them  on  paper. I  started  scanning  every  page  on  my\\nfamily’s home computer, turning them into digital records that could be searched,\\nrearranged,  annotated,  and  shared. I became  the  project  manager  of  my  own\\ncondition,  taking  detailed  notes  on  everything  my  doctors  told  me,  trying  out\\nevery suggestion they made, and generating questions to review during my next\\nappointment. With  all  this  information  in  one  place,  patterns  began  to  emerge. With  my\\ndoctors’ help, I discovered a class of afflictions called “functional voice disorders,”\\nwhich  included  problems  with  any  of  the  more  than  fifty  pairs  of  muscles\\nrequired to properly swallow a piece of food.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"17e6c71f-6b7b-416c-acd0-62e3c2593c01":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"17e6c71f-6b7b-416c-acd0-62e3c2593c01\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"b8fa6d1b-c64b-4388-8700-5a2dccda61f7\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"19eef4fa-b00d-4186-bab7-d406a4121739\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"I realized that the medications I was\\n\\ntaking were masking my symptoms, and in the process making it harder to hear\\nwhat they were telling me.

I  began  to  research  how  breathing,  nutrition,  vocal  habits,  and  even  past\\nexperiences  in  childhood  can  be  manifested  in  the  nervous  system. I  started  to\\nunderstand the mind-body connection and how my thoughts and feelings directly\\nimpacted the way my body felt. Taking notes on everything I learned, I devised an\\nexperiment: I would try a few simple lifestyle changes, such as improving my diet\\nand regular meditation, combined with a series of voice exercises I learned from a\\nvoice  therapist. To  my  shock  and  amazement,  it  began  to  work  almost\\nimmediately. My pain didn’t disappear, but it became far more manageable. I\\nAs I look back, my notes were as important in finding relief as any medicine or\\nprocedure. They gave me the chance to step back from the details of my condition\\nand see my situation from a different perspective. For both the outer world of\\nmedicine and the inner world of sensations, my notes were a practical medium for\\nturning any new information I encountered into practical solutions I could use. From then on, I became obsessed with the potential of technology to channel\\nthe  information  all  around  me. I  began  to  realize  that  the  simple  act  of  taking\\nnotes on a computer was the tip of an iceberg. Because once made digital, notes\\nwere no longer limited to short, handwritten scribbles—they could take any form,\\nincluding  images,  links,  and  files  of  any  shape  and  size. In  the  digital  realm,\\ninformation  could  be  molded  and  shaped  and  directed  to  any  purpose,  like  a\\nmagical, primordial force of nature. I started using digital notetaking in other parts of my life. In my college classes,\\nI turned stacks of disheveled spiral-bound notebooks into an elegant, searchable\\ncollection  of  lessons. I  learned  to  master  the  process  of  writing  down  only  the\\nmost important points from my classes, reviewing them on demand, and using\\nthem to compose an essay or pass a test. I had always been a mediocre student\\nwith average grades. My early schoolteachers would regularly send me home with\\nreport  cards  noting  my  short  attention  span  and  wandering  mind. You  can\\nimagine my delight when I graduated from college with a nearly straight-A grade\\npoint average and university honors. I  had  the  misfortune  of  graduating  into  one  of  the  worst  job  markets  in  a\\ngeneration,  in  the  aftermath  of  the  2008  financial  crisis. Faced  with  few\\nemployment opportunities in the United States, I decided to join the Peace Corps,\\nan  overseas  volunteer  program  that  sends  Americans  to  serve  in  developing\\ncountries. I was accepted and assigned to a small school in the eastern Ukrainian\\ncountryside,  where  I  would  spend  two  years  teaching  English  to  students  aged\\neight to eighteen. Working  as  a  teacher  with  few  resources  and  little  support,  my  notetaking\\nsystem once again became my lifeline. I saved examples of lessons and exercises\\nanywhere I found them: from textbooks, websites, and USB drives passed around\\nby other teachers. I mixed and matched English phrases, expressions, and slang\\ninto word games to keep my energetic third graders engaged. I taught the older\\nstudents the basics of personal productivity—how to keep a schedule, how to take\\nnotes in class, and how to set goals and plan their education. I will never forget\\ntheir appreciation as they grew up and used those skills to apply to universities and\\nsucceed in their first jobs. Years later, I still regularly receive messages of gratitude\\nas the productivity skills I taught my former students continue to bear fruit in\\ntheir lives.

Moving straight from rural Ukraine to the epicenter of Silicon\\nValley, I was utterly unprepared for the constant barrage of inputs that is a normal\\npart of modern workplaces. Every day I received hundreds of emails, every hour\\ndozens  of  messages,  and  the  pings  and  dings  from  every  device  merged  into  a\\nceaseless melody of interruption. I remember looking around at my colleagues and\\nwondering, “How can anyone get anything done here? What’s their secret?” I knew only one trick, and it started with writing things down. I started taking notes on everything I was learning using a notetaking app on\\nmy  computer. I  took  notes  during  meetings,  on  phone  calls,  and  while  doing\\nresearch online. I wrote down facts gleaned from research papers that could be\\nused in the slides we presented to clients. I wrote down tidbits of insight I came\\nacross  on  social  media,  to  share  on  our  own  social  channels. I  wrote  down\\n\\nfeedback from my more experienced colleagues so I could make sure I digested it\\nand took it to heart. Every time we started a new project, I created a dedicated\\nplace  on  my  computer  for  the  information  related  to  it,  where  I  could  sort\\nthrough it all and decide on a plan of action. As the information tide receded, I started to gain a sense of confidence in my\\nability to find exactly what I needed when I needed it. I became the go-to person\\nin the office for finding that one file, or unearthing that one fact, or remembering\\nexactly  what  the  client  had  said  three  weeks  earlier. You  know  the  feeling  of\\nsatisfaction when you are the only one in the room who remembers an important\\ndetail? That feeling became the prize in my personal pursuit to capitalize on the\\nvalue of what I knew. Another Shift—Discovering the Power of Sharing\\nMy collection of notes and files had always been for my own personal use, but as I\\nworked on consulting projects for some of the most important organizations in\\nthe world, I started to realize that it could be a business asset as well. I  learned  from  one  of  the  reports  we  published  that  the  value  of  physical\\ncapital  in  the  US—land,  machinery,  and  buildings  for  example—is  about  $10\\ntrillion, but that value is dwarfed by the total value of human capital, which is\\nestimated to be five to ten times larger. Human capital includes “the knowledge\\nand the knowhow embodied in humans—their education, their experience, their\\nwisdom, their skills, their relationships, their common sense, their intuition.” 1\\nIf  that  was  true,  was  it  possible  that  my  personal  collection  of  notes  was  a\\nknowledge asset that could grow and compound over time? I began to see my as-\\nyet-unnamed Second Brain not just as a notetaking tool but as a loyal confidant\\nand thought partner. When I was forgetful, it always remembered. When I lost\\nmy way, it reminded me where we were going. When I felt stuck and at a loss for\\nideas, it suggested possibilities and pathways. At one point some of my colleagues asked me to teach them my organizing\\nmethods. I found that virtually all of them already used various productivity tools,\\nsuch as paper notepads or the apps on their smartphones, but that very few did so\\n\\nin a systematic, intentional way. They tended to move information around from\\nplace to place haphazardly, reacting to the demands of the moment, never quite\\ntrusting that they’d be able to find it again. Every new productivity app promised\\na breakthrough, but usually ended up becoming yet another thing to manage.

An article I wrote about how to use digital notetaking to\\nenhance creativity went viral in the productivity community, and I was invited to\\nspeak and teach workshops at influential companies like Genentech, Toyota, and\\nthe  Inter-American  Development  Bank. In  early  2017,  I  decided  to  create  an\\nonline course called “Building a Second Brain” to  teach  my  system  on  a  wider\\nscale.

Part  Two,  “The  Method,”\\nintroduces each of the four steps you’ll follow to build a Second Brain so you can\\nimmediately  begin  to  capture  and  share  ideas  with  more  intention. And  Part\\nThree,  “Making  Things  Happen,”  offers  a  set  of  powerful  ways  to  use  your\\nSecond Brain to enhance your productivity, accomplish your goals, and thrive in\\nyour work and life. I’ve shared my story with you because I want you to know that this book isn’t\\nabout perfectly optimizing some kind of idealized life. Everyone experiences pain,\\nmakes mistakes, and struggles at some point in their lives. I’ve had my fair share of\\nchallenges,  but  at  each  stage  of  my  journey,  treating  my  thoughts  as  treasures\\nworth  keeping  has  been  the  pivotal  element  in  everything  I’ve  overcome  and\\nachieved. You may find this book in the “self-improvement” category, but in a deeper\\nsense it is the opposite of self-improvement. It is about optimizing a system outside\\nyourself,  a  system  not  subject  to  your  limitations  and  constraints,  leaving  you\\nhappily unoptimized and free to roam, to wonder, to wander  toward  whatever\\nmakes you feel alive here and now in each moment.

We extend beyond our limits, not by revving our brains like a machine\\nor bulking them up like a muscle—but by strewing our world with rich\\nmaterials, and by weaving them into our thoughts. —Annie Murphy Paul, author of The Extended Mind\\nInformation is the fundamental building block of everything you do. Anything you might want to accomplish—executing a project at work, getting\\na new job, learning a new skill, starting a business—requires finding and putting\\nto use the right information. Your professional success and quality of life depend\\ndirectly on your ability to manage information effectively. According to the New York Times, the average person’s daily consumption of\\ninformation now adds up to a remarkable 34 gigabytes. 1\\n A separate study cited by\\nthe Times  estimates  that  we  consume  the  equivalent  of  174  full  newspapers’\\nworth of content each and every day, five times higher than in 1986. 2\\nInstead of empowering us, this deluge of information often overwhelms us. Information  Overload  has  become  Information  Exhaustion,  taxing  our  mental\\nresources  and  leaving  us  constantly  anxious that  we’re  forgetting  something. Instantaneous access to the world’s knowledge through the Internet was supposed\\nto  educate  and  inform  us,  but  instead  it  has  created  a  society-wide  poverty  of\\nattention. I\\nResearch from Microsoft shows that the average US employee spends 76 hours\\nper  year  looking  for  misplaced  notes,  items,  or  files. 3\\n  And  a  report  from  the\\nInternational  Data  Corporation  found  that  26  percent  of  a  typical  knowledge\\nworker’s day is spent looking for and consolidating information spread across a\\n\\nvariety of systems. 4\\n Incredibly, only 56 percent of the time are they able to find\\nthe information required to do their jobs. In other words, we go to work five days per week, but spend more than one of\\nthose days on average just looking for the information we need to do our work. Half the time, we don’t even succeed in doing that. It’s time for us to upgrade our Paleolithic memory. It’s time to acknowledge\\nthat  we  can’t  “use  our  head”  to  store  everything  we  need  to  know  and  to\\noutsource the job of remembering to intelligent machines. We have to recognize\\nthat the cognitive demands of modern life increase every year, but we’re still using\\nthe same brains as two hundred thousand years ago, when modern humans first\\nemerged on the plains of East Africa. Every bit of energy we spend straining to recall things is energy not spent doing\\nthe  thinking  that  only  humans  can  do:  inventing  new  things,  crafting  stories,\\nrecognizing  patterns,  following  our  intuition,  collaborating  with  others,\\ninvestigating new subjects, making plans, testing theories. Every minute we spend\\ntrying  to  mentally  juggle  all  the  stuff  we  have  to  do  leaves  less  time  for  more\\nmeaningful pursuits  like  cooking,  self-care,  hobbies,  resting,  and  spending  time\\nwith loved ones. However, there’s a catch: every change in how we use technology also requires\\na change in how we think. To properly take advantage of the power of a Second\\nBrain,  we  need  a  new  relationship  to  information,  to  technology,  and  even  to\\nourselves. The Legacy of Commonplace Books\\nFor insight into our own time, we can look to history for lessons on what worked\\nin other eras. The practice of writing down one’s thoughts and notes to help make\\nsense of the world has a long legacy. For centuries, artists and intellectuals from\\nLeonardo da Vinci to Virginia Woolf, from John Locke to Octavia Butler, have\\nrecorded the ideas they found most interesting in a book they carried around with\\nthem, known as a “commonplace book.”\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4b3370ed-b467-4b0d-b83a-599ddd9a0869":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4b3370ed-b467-4b0d-b83a-599ddd9a0869\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"195e6b1d-f31a-431d-88c4-10b7a9d6131c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"62ba6cd4-34e8-488a-bc9c-646f161365f5\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"II\\n\\nPopularized  in  a  previous  period  of  information  overload,  the  Industrial\\nRevolution of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the commonplace\\nbook was more than a diary or journal of personal reflections. It was a learning\\ntool that the educated class used to understand a rapidly changing world and their\\nplace in it. In The Case for Books,\\n5\\n historian and former director of the Harvard University\\nLibrary Robert Darnton explains the role of commonplace books:\\nUnlike modern readers, who follow the flow of a narrative from beginning to\\nend, early modern Englishmen read in fits and starts and jumped from book\\nto  book. They  broke  texts  into  fragments  and  assembled  them  into  new\\npatterns  by  transcribing  them  in  different  sections  of  their  notebooks. Then\\nthey  reread  the  copies  and  rearranged  the  patterns  while  adding  more\\nexcerpts. Reading  and  writing  were  therefore  inseparable  activities. They\\nbelonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full\\nof  signs:  you  could  read  your  way  through  it;  and  by  keeping  an  account  of\\nyour  readings,  you  made  a  book  of  your  own,  one  stamped  with  your\\npersonality. III\\nCommonplace  books  were  a  portal  through  which  educated  people  interacted\\nwith the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to\\nconnect  bits  of  knowledge  from  different  sources  and  to  inspire  their  own\\nthinking. As  a  society,  all  of  us  could  benefit  from  the  modern  equivalent  of  a\\ncommonplace  book. The  media  landscape  of  today  is  oriented  toward  what  is\\nnovel and public—the latest political controversy, the new celebrity scandal, or the\\nviral meme of the day. Resurrecting the commonplace book allows us to stem the\\ntide,  shifting  our  relationship  with  information  toward  the timeless  and  the\\nprivate. Instead  of  consuming  ever-greater  amounts  of  content,  we  could  take  on  a\\nmore  patient,  thoughtful  approach  that  favors  rereading,  reformulating,  and\\nworking through the implications of ideas over time. Not only could this lead to\\n\\nmore civil discussions about the important topics of the day; it could also preserve\\nour mental health and heal our splintered attention. But  this  isn’t  simply  a  return  to  the  past. We  now  have  the  opportunity  to\\nsupercharge the custom of commonplace books for the modern era. We have the\\nchance  to  turn  that  historical  practice  into  something  far  more  flexible  and\\nconvenient. The Digital Commonplace Book\\nOnce our notes and observations become digital, they can be searched, organized\\nand  synced  across  all  our  devices,  and  backed  up  to  the  cloud  for  safekeeping. Instead of randomly scribbling down notes on pieces of paper, hoping we’ll be\\nable to find them later, we can cultivate our very own “knowledge vault” so we\\nalways know exactly where to look. Writer and photographer Craig Mod wrote, “There is a gaping opportunity to\\nconsolidate  our  myriad  marginalia\\nIV\\n  into  an  even  more  robust  commonplace\\nbook. One searchable, always accessible, easily shared and embedded amongst the\\ndigital text we consume.” 6\\nThis digital commonplace book is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the\\ncombination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new\\nideas. It is a multipurpose tool that can adapt to your changing needs over time. In\\nschool or courses you take, it can be used to take notes for studying. At work, it\\ncan  help  you  organize  your  projects. At  home,  it  can  help  you  manage  your\\nhousehold. However  you  decide  to  use  it,  your  Second  Brain  is  a  private  knowledge\\ncollection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use\\ncase.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"62ba6cd4-34e8-488a-bc9c-646f161365f5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"62ba6cd4-34e8-488a-bc9c-646f161365f5\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"4b3370ed-b467-4b0d-b83a-599ddd9a0869\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"14a8ffcb-28f5-4e87-a685-a2ccf43e6525\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solitude\\nbefore sharing it with others.

Rethinking Notetaking: Notes as Knowledge Building Blocks\\nIn past centuries, only the intellectual elite needed commonplace books—writers,\\npoliticians,  philosophers,  and  scientists  who  had  a  reason  to  synthesize  their\\nwriting or research. Nowadays, almost everyone needs a way to manage information. More than half the workforce today can be considered “knowledge workers”—\\nprofessionals for whom knowledge is their most valuable asset, and who spend a\\nmajority of their time managing large amounts of information. In addition, no\\nmatter what our formal role is, all of us have to come up with new ideas, solve\\nnovel problems, and communicate with others effectively. We have to do these\\nthings regularly, reliably, not just once in a while. As  a  knowledge  worker,  where  does  your  knowledge  live? Where  does  your\\nknowledge go when it’s created or discovered? “Knowledge” can seem like a lofty\\nconcept reserved exclusively for scholars and academics, but at the most practical\\nlevel, knowledge begins with the simple, time-honored practice of taking notes. For  many  people,  their  understanding  of  notetaking  was  formed  in  school. You were probably first told to write something down because it would be on the\\ntest. This implied that the minute the test was over, you would never reference\\nthose notes again. Learning was treated as essentially disposable, with no intention\\nof that knowledge being useful for the long term. When  you  enter  the  professional  world,  the  demands  on  your  notetaking\\nchange completely. The entire approach to notetaking you learned in school is not\\n\\nonly obsolete, it’s the exact opposite of what you need. In the professional world:\\nIt’s not at all clear what you should be taking notes on. No one tells you when or how your notes will be used. The “test” can come at any time and in any form. You’re allowed to reference your notes at any time, provided you took them\\nin the first place. You are expected to take action on your notes, not just regurgitate them. This isn’t the same notetaking you learned in school. It’s time to elevate the status\\nof  notes  from  test  prep  and  humble  scribblings  into  something  far  more\\ninteresting  and  dynamic. For  modern,  professional  notetaking,  a  note  is  a\\n“knowledge building block”—a discrete unit of information interpreted through\\nyour unique perspective and stored outside your head. By this definition, a note could include a passage from a book or article that\\nyou were inspired by; a photo or image from the web with your annotations; or a\\nbullet-point  list  of  your  meandering  thoughts  on  a  topic,  among  many  other\\nexamples. A note could include a single quote from a film that really struck you,\\nall the way to thousands of words you saved from an in-depth book. The length\\nand format don’t matter—if a piece of content has been interpreted through your\\nlens, curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or drawn\\nfrom your life experience, and stored in a secure place, then it qualifies as a note. A knowledge building block is discrete.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"14a8ffcb-28f5-4e87-a685-a2ccf43e6525":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"14a8ffcb-28f5-4e87-a685-a2ccf43e6525\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"62ba6cd4-34e8-488a-bc9c-646f161365f5\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"546808e8-f048-4cb2-b5d4-bc461d2bb8f6\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"A knowledge building block is discrete.

A Tale of Two Brains\\nLet me paint a picture of a day in the life of someone who doesn’t have a Second\\nBrain, and someone who does. See if either of these descriptions sounds familiar. Nina wakes up on Monday morning, and before her eyes even open, thoughts\\nare flooding her brain. Things to do, things to think about, things to decide. It all\\ncomes rushing in from the depths of her subconscious, where it’s been simmering\\nall weekend. Nina’s thoughts continue to swirl around her brain as she gets ready for work. Like jittery birds, they flit and flutter around her head because they have nowhere\\nelse to rest. There is a constant hum of background anxiety that she has come to\\nexpect, as she wonders what needs her attention and what she may be missing. After a hectic morning, Nina finally sits down at her desk to start her workday,\\nopens up her email inbox, and is instantly engulfed by a torrent of new messages. Flashing  with  urgent  subject  lines  and  the  names  of  important  senders,  these\\ndemands fill her with a cold adrenaline rush. She knows that her morning is shot,\\nher own plans ruined. Pushing aside the important work she wanted to focus on\\nthis morning, Nina settles in for a long slog of replying to emails. By the time she gets back from lunch, Nina is finally done handling the most\\nurgent issues. It’s finally time to focus on the priorities she’s set for herself. This is\\nwhen  the  reality  sets  in:  after  a  morning  spent  fighting  fires,  she’s  far  too\\nscatterbrained  and  tired  to  focus. Like  so  many  times  before,  Nina  lowers  her\\nexpectations, settling for chipping away slowly at her ever-expanding to-do list full\\nof other people’s priorities. After work, Nina has one last chance to work on the project that she knows\\nwill make use of her talents and take her career to the next level. She exercises, eats\\ndinner, and spends some quality time with the kids. As they go to bed, she’s filled\\nwith enthusiasm that she finally gets some time to herself. She sits down at the computer, and the questions begin: “Where did I leave off\\nlast time? Where did I put that file? Where are all my notes?” By the time Nina gets set up and ready to go, she’s far too tired to make real\\nprogress. This  pattern  repeats  itself  day  after  day. After  enough  of  these  false\\nstarts,  she  starts  to  give  up. Why  even  try? Why  keep  attempting  to  do  the\\nimpossible? Why resist the temptation to watch another Netflix episode or scroll\\nthrough  social  media? Without  the  time  and  energy  to  move  things  decisively\\nforward, what’s the point of starting? Nina is a competent, responsible, and hardworking professional. Many people\\nwould feel privileged to be in her shoes.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"546808e8-f048-4cb2-b5d4-bc461d2bb8f6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"546808e8-f048-4cb2-b5d4-bc461d2bb8f6\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"14a8ffcb-28f5-4e87-a685-a2ccf43e6525\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"49302849-7fba-467c-aab2-007185fac073\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Many people\\nwould feel privileged to be in her shoes.

So  many  of  us  share  the  feeling  that  we  are  surrounded  by  knowledge,  yet\\nstarving for wisdom. That despite all the mind-expanding ideas we have access to,\\nthe quality of our attention is only getting worse. That we are paralyzed by the\\nconflict between our responsibilities and our most heartfelt passions, so that we’re\\nnever quite able to focus and also never quite able to rest.

It is\\nalso drawn from the real-life stories I’ve received, this time from people who have\\nbuilt a Second Brain for themselves. You wake up Monday morning, looking forward to starting your day and your\\nweek. As you get out of bed, take a shower, and get dressed, the thoughts start\\narriving. You have just as many worries and responsibilities as anyone else, but you\\nalso have a secret weapon. In the shower, you suddenly realize there’s a better way to advance the project\\nyou’re focused on at work. As you step out onto the mat, you jot down the idea as\\na digital note on your smartphone. Over breakfast with your family, you find your\\nmind  already  working  out  the  new  strategy,  pondering  its  implications. Those\\nthoughts get jotted down as well, in the brief moments between feeding the kids\\nand sending them off to school. As you drive to work, you start realizing there are\\nchallenges  you  haven’t  considered. You  dictate  a  quick  audio  memo  to  your\\nphone as you drive, which gets automatically transcribed and saved in your notes. Monday morning in the office is the usual whirlwind, with emails and chat\\nmessages and phone calls arriving at their usual frantic pace. As you share your\\nnew  idea  with  your  colleagues,  they  start  asking  questions,  pointing  out  valid\\nconcerns, and adding their own contributions. At each of these moments, you are\\nready  to  save  them  as  notes  in  your  Second  Brain. You  withhold  judgment,\\nseeking to gather the widest possible range of feedback before deciding on a course\\nof action. Before you know it, it’s lunchtime. As you take a break to grab a bite to eat,\\nyour thoughts turn philosophical: “What is the ultimate point of the project, and\\nare we forgetting it? How does it fit into the long-term vision of the product we\\nwant to build? What is the impact of the new strategy on shareholders, customers,\\nsuppliers, and the environment?” You have only thirty minutes to eat lunch, and\\nyou don’t have time to ponder these questions in depth, but you note them down\\nas a reminder to think about later. You are on your smartphone just like everyone else, but you aren’t doing what\\nthey are doing. You are creating value instead of killing time. By the time the afternoon meeting comes around to review the strategy you’ve\\ncome  up  with,  you  already  have  a  formidable  collection  of  notes  ready  and\\nwaiting:  the  ideas,  strategies,  objectives,  challenges,  questions,  concerns,\\ncontributions, and reminders you’ve collected over just a few hours on a Monday\\nmorning.

As the meeting begins, the team sits down to start discussing the project. You\\nare already prepared.

All the important\\nreflections, new ideas, and unexpected possibilities your colleagues come up with\\nalso get recorded in your Second Brain. As this way of working with information continues over days and weeks and\\nmonths, the way your mind works begins to change. You start to see recurring\\npatterns in your thinking: why you do things, what you really want, and what’s\\nreally important to you. Your Second Brain becomes like a mirror, teaching you\\nabout yourself and reflecting back to you the ideas worth keeping and acting on.

They  remark  on  your  amazing\\nmemory,  but  what  they  don’t  know  is  that  you  never  even  try  to  remember\\nanything. They  admire  your  incredible  dedication  to  developing  your  thinking\\nover time. In reality, you are just planting seeds of inspiration and harvesting them\\nas they flower. As you begin to see all the knowledge you’ve gained in tangible form, it dawns\\non you that you already have everything you need to strike out toward the future\\nyou want. There’s no need to wait until you’re perfectly prepared. No need to\\nconsume more information or do more research. All that’s left is for you to take\\n\\naction on what you already know and already have, which is laid out before you in\\nmeticulous detail. Your brain is no longer the bottleneck on your potential, which means you\\nhave all the bandwidth you need to pursue any endeavor and make it successful. This sense of confidence in the quality of your thinking gives you the freedom to\\nask deeper questions and the courage to pursue bigger challenges. You can’t fail,\\nbecause failure is just more information, to be captured and used as fuel for your\\njourney. This is what it’s like to build and harness the power of a Second Brain.

VII\\nTheir efforts were not in vain. Those ideas inspired much of the technology\\nthat we use every day, but paradoxically, despite all the technological inventions of\\nthe Information Age, we are in some ways further from their original vision than\\never.

I  believe  that  we  have  reached  an  inflection  point,  where  technology  has\\nbecome sufficiently advanced and user-friendly that we can integrate it with our\\nbiological  brains. Computers  have  become  smaller,  more  powerful,  and  more\\nintuitive, to the point that they are unmistakably an essential component of how\\nwe think. The time has come for us to realize the vision of technology’s early pioneers—\\nthat everyone should have an extended mind not just to remember more and be\\nmore productive, but to lead more fulfilling lives. I. Herbert Simon, an American economist and cognitive psychologist, wrote, “What information consumes is\\nrather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of\\nattention...” II. The word “commonplace” can be traced back to Ancient Greece, where a speaker in law courts or political\\nmeetings would keep an assortment of arguments in a “common place” for easy reference. III. The  practice  of  keeping  personal  notes  also  arose  in  other  countries,  such  as biji  in  China  (roughly\\ntranslated as “notebook”), which could contain anecdotes, quotations, random musings, literary criticism,\\nshort fictional stories, and anything else that a person thought worth recording. In Japan, zuihitsu (known as\\n“pillow books”) were collections of notebooks used to document a person’s life. IV. “Marginalia” refers to the marks made in the margins of a book or other document, including scribbles,\\ncomments, annotations, critiques, doodles, or illustrations. V. Have you ever lost your smartphone or been unable to access the Internet, and felt like a critical part of\\nyourself was missing? That’s a sign that an external tool has become an extension of your mind. In a 2004\\nstudy, Angelo Maravita and Atsushi Iriki discovered that when monkeys and humans consistently use a tool\\nto extend their reach, such as using a rake to reach an object, certain neural networks in the brain change their\\n“map” of the body to include the new tool. This fascinating finding reinforces the idea that external tools can\\nand often do become a natural extension of our minds. VI. Recent advancements and discoveries in the field of “extended cognition” have shed new light on how\\npractical and powerful it can be to “think outside the brain.” This book isn’t focused on the science, but for\\nan excellent introduction to extended cognition I recommend The Extended Mind by Annie Murphy Paul. VII. Vannevar Bush wrote of a “scholar’s workstation” called a “Memex,” which was “a device in which an\\nindividual  stores  all  his  books,  records,  and  communications,  and  which  is  mechanized  so  that  it  may  be\\nconsulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.” Chapter 3\\nHow a Second Brain Works\\nIt is in the power of remembering that the self’s ultimate freedom\\nconsists. I am free because I remember. —Abhinavagupta, tenth-century Kashmiri philosopher and mystic\\nThink of your Second Brain as the world’s best personal assistant. It is perfectly reliable and totally consistent. It is always ready and waiting to\\ncapture any bit of information that might be of value to you.

The Superpowers of a Second Brain\\nThere  are  four  essential  capabilities  that  we  can  rely  on  a  Second  Brain  to\\nperform for us:\\n\\n1. Making our ideas concrete. 2. Revealing new associations between ideas. 3. Incubating our ideas over time. 4. Sharpening our unique perspectives. Let’s examine each of these. Second Brain Superpower #1: Make Our Ideas Concrete\\nBefore we do anything with our ideas, we have to “off-load” them from our minds\\nand put them into concrete form. Only when we declutter our brain of complex\\nideas can we think clearly and start to work with those ideas effectively. In 1953, American biologist James Watson and English physicist Francis Crick\\nmade  a  profound  discovery:  the  structure  of  DNA  was  a  double  helix. Their\\ndiscovery  was  built  on  the  groundwork  laid  by  other  pioneers,  including\\nadvancements  in  X-ray  crystallography  by  Rosalind  Franklin  and  Maurice\\nWilkins, and ushered in a golden age in molecular biology and genetics. Watson and Crick’s breakthrough is well recognized, but there is a part of their\\nstory  that  is  much  less  well  known. An  important  tool  of  the  researchers  was\\nbuilding physical models, an approach they borrowed from American biochemist\\nLinus Pauling. They made cardboard cutouts to approximate the shapes of the\\nmolecules  they  knew were  part  of  DNA’s  makeup  and,  like  a  puzzle,\\nexperimented  with  different  ways  of  putting  them  together. They  would  shift\\naround their models on their desktops, trying to find a shape that fit everything\\nthey knew about how the molecules were arranged. The double helix structure\\nseemed to fit all known constraints, allowing the complementary base pairs to fit\\ntogether  perfectly  while  respecting  the  ratios  between  elements  that  had  been\\nmeasured previously. 1\\nThis is a remarkable aspect of one of the most famous scientific discoveries of\\nthe  last  century:  at  the  decisive  moment,  even  highly  trained  scientists  deeply\\nfamiliar  with  mathematical  and  abstract  thinking  turned  to  the  most  basic,\\nancient medium available: physical stuff. Digital notes aren’t physical, but they are visual. They turn vague concepts into\\ntangible entities that can be observed, rearranged, edited, and combined together. They may exist only in virtual form, but we can still see them with our eyes and\\nmove  them  around  with  our  fingers. As  researchers  Deborah  Chambers  and\\nDaniel Reisberg found in their research on the limits of mental visualization, “The\\nskills we have developed for dealing with the external world go beyond those we\\nhave for dealing with the internal world.” 2\\nSecond Brain Superpower #2: Reveal New Associations\\nBetween Ideas\\nIn its most practical form, creativity is about connecting ideas together, especially\\nideas that don’t seem to be connected. Neuroscientist  Nancy  C. Andreasen,  in  her  extensive  research  on  highly\\ncreative  people  including  accomplished  scientists,  mathematicians,  artists,  and\\nwriters,  came  to  the  conclusion  that  “Creative  people  are  better  at  recognizing\\nrelationships, making associations and connections.” 3\\nBy keeping diverse kinds of material in one place, we facilitate this connectivity\\nand increase the likelihood that we’ll notice an unusual association. Quotes from a philosophy book written in ancient times might sit next to the\\nlatest clever tweet. Screenshots from an interesting YouTube video can live right\\nby scenes from classic movies. An audio memo might be saved alongside project\\nplans, a link to a helpful website, and a PDF with the latest research findings.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"be43a2a9-1d4f-4465-80d1-25ca4dc77813":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"be43a2a9-1d4f-4465-80d1-25ca4dc77813\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"c817c27c-18c7-4c0f-acae-d3638c00a602\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"c71a077f-5ffe-4bec-91e7-80ce403bd58f\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"All\\nthese formats can be combined in a way that would be impossible in the physical\\nworld. If you’ve ever played the word-tile game Scrabble, you know the best way to\\ncome up with new words is to mix up the letters in different combinations until a\\nword jumps out at you. In our Second Brain we can do the same: mix up the order\\nof our ideas until something unexpected emerges. The more diverse and unusual\\nthe material you put into it in the first place, the more original the connections\\nthat will emerge. Second Brain Superpower #3: Incubate Our Ideas Over Time\\nToo often when we take on a task—planning an event, designing a product, or\\nleading an initiative—we draw only on the ideas we have access to right in that\\nmoment. I  call  this  approach  a  “heavy  lift”—demanding  instantaneous  results\\nfrom our brains without the benefit of a support system. Even when we do a brainstorm, that still relies only on ideas that we can think\\nup  right  now. What  are  the  chances  that  the  most  creative,  most  innovative\\napproaches will instantly be top of mind? What are the odds that the best way to\\nmove forward is one of the first ways we come up with? This tendency is known as recency bias. 4\\n We tend to favor the ideas, solutions,\\nand influences that occurred to us most recently, regardless of whether they are\\nthe best ones. Now imagine if you were able to unshackle yourself from the limits\\nof the present moment, and draw on weeks, months, or even years of accumulated\\nimagination. I call this approach the “slow burn”—allowing bits of thought matter to slowly\\nsimmer  like  a  delicious  pot  of  stew  brewing  on  the  stove. It  is  a  calmer,  more\\nsustainable approach to creativity that relies on the gradual accumulation of ideas,\\ninstead of all-out binges of manic hustle. Having a Second Brain where lots of\\nideas can be permanently saved for the long term turns the passage of time into\\nyour friend, instead of your enemy. Second Brain Superpower #4: Sharpen Our Unique\\nPerspectives\\nUntil  now  we’ve  talked  mostly  about  gathering  the  ideas  of  others,  but  the\\nultimate purpose of a Second Brain is to allow your own thinking to shine. A recent study from Princeton University found that there is a certain kind of\\njob that is least likely to be automated by machines in coming years. Surprisingly,\\nit wasn’t jobs that required advanced skills or years of training that were predicted\\nto fare best. It was jobs that required the ability to convey “not just information\\nbut a particular interpretation of information.” 5\\n\\nIn  other  words,  the  jobs  that  are  most  likely  to  stick  around  are  those  that\\ninvolve promoting or defending a particular perspective. Think of a fundraising\\norganizer sharing stories of the impact their nonprofit has made, a researcher using\\ndata to back up their interpretation of an experiment, or a project manager citing\\na  couple  of  key  precedents  to  support  a  decision. Our  careers  and  businesses\\ndepend more than ever on our ability to advance a particular point of view and\\npersuade others to adopt it as well. 6\\nAdvocating  for  a  particular  point  of  view  isn’t  just  a  matter  of  sparkling\\ncharisma or irresistible charm. It takes supporting material. American journalist, author, and filmmaker Sebastian Junger once wrote on\\nthe subject of “writer’s block”: “It’s not that I’m blocked. It’s that I don’t have\\nenough research to write with power and knowledge about that topic. It always\\nmeans, not that I can’t find the right words, [but rather] that I don’t have the\\nammunition.” 7\\nWhen  you  feel  stuck  in  your  creative  pursuits,  it  doesn’t  mean  that  there’s\\nsomething wrong with you. You haven’t lost your touch or run out of creative\\njuice. It just means you don’t yet have enough raw material to work with.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c71a077f-5ffe-4bec-91e7-80ce403bd58f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c71a077f-5ffe-4bec-91e7-80ce403bd58f\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"be43a2a9-1d4f-4465-80d1-25ca4dc77813\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"bf8fed3a-167f-4de2-a499-21d20f973920\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"It just means you don’t yet have enough raw material to work with.

Choosing a Notetaking App: The Neural Center of Your\\nSecond Brain\\nThe same technology that has fueled an explosion in the volume of information\\ncoming our way has also provided the tools to help us manage it. While your Second Brain is made up of all the tools you use to interact with\\ninformation,  including  a  to-do  list,  a  calendar,  email,  and  reading  apps,  for\\nexample, there is one category of software I recommend as the centerpiece of your\\nSecond  Brain:  a  digital  notetaking  app. I\\n  There  are  plentiful  options  available,\\n\\nfrom the free notes app that came preinstalled on your smartphone to third-party\\nsoftware you can download with exactly the features you need. From  Microsoft  OneNote,  Google  Keep,  and  Apple  Notes  to  Notion  and\\nEvernote,  digital  notes  apps  have  four  powerful  characteristics  that  make  them\\nideal for building a Second Brain. They are:\\nMultimedia:  Just  like  a  paper  notebook  might  contain  drawings  and\\nsketches, quotes and ideas, and even a pasted photo or Post-it, a notes app\\ncan store a wide variety of different kinds of content in one place, so you\\nnever need to wonder where to put something. Informal:  Notes  are  inherently  messy,  so  there’s  no  need  for  perfect\\nspelling or polished presentation. This makes it as easy and frictionless as\\npossible to jot things down as soon as they occur to you, which is essential\\nto allow nascent ideas to grow. Open-ended: Taking notes is a continuous process that never really ends,\\nand you don’t always know where it might lead. Unlike more specialized\\nkinds  of  software  that  are  designed  to  produce  a  specific  kind  of  output\\n(such as slide decks, spreadsheets, graphics, or videos), notes are ideal for\\nfree-form exploration before you have a goal in mind. Action-oriented:  Unlike  a  library  or  research  database,  personal  notes\\ndon’t need to be comprehensive or precise. They are designed to help you\\nquickly capture stray thoughts so you can remain focused on the task at\\nhand. All four of the above qualities are shared by paper notes, but when we make\\nthem  digital,  we  can  supercharge  these  timeless  benefits  with  the  incredible\\ncapabilities of technology—searching, sharing, backups, editing, linking, syncing\\nbetween devices, and many others. Digital notes combine the casual artistry of a\\ndaily sketchbook with the scientific power of modern software. Choosing which apps and tools you’ll use is a personal decision, and depends\\non which mobile device you use, the needs of your job or business, and even your\\nown temperament and taste. The software landscape is dynamic and constantly\\n\\nchanging. New apps regularly come out, and existing ones release innovative new\\nfeatures. You can find a free, continually updated guide to choosing your notes\\napp and other Second Brain tools at Buildingasecondbrain. com/resources. Although  you  will  always  use  many  different  software  programs  to  manage\\ninformation and  do  your  work—from  word  processors  to  messaging  platforms\\nand project management tools used within your organization—your notes app is\\nuniquely designed to facilitate personal knowledge management. A good place to start is to look at the apps you already have and perhaps are\\nalready using. You can always start now with a basic option and upgrade later as\\nyour needs get more sophisticated.

Remembering, Connecting, Creating: The Three Stages of\\nPersonal Knowledge Management\\nAs people set out on their Second Brain journey, there are three stages of progress\\nI often observe—and even encourage. Those stages are remembering, connecting,\\nand creating. It  takes  time  to  fully  unlock  the  value  of  using  digital  tools  to\\nenhance  and  extend  what  our  minds  are  capable  of,  but  there  are  also  distinct\\nbenefits at every step along the way. The first way that people tend to use their Second Brain is as a memory aid. They use their digital notes to save facts and ideas that they would have trouble\\nrecalling  otherwise:  takeaways  from  meetings,  quotes  from  interviews,  or  the\\ndetails of a project, for example. Camille is the cofounder and lead designer of a start-up in Quebec, Canada. She uses her Second Brain to save excerpts from the many research reports and\\nstudies she reads as part of her work designing electric vehicle charging stations for\\nlarge  residential  buildings. Most  of  these  reports  are  published  as  PDFs,  a\\n\\nnotoriously inflexible and difficult-to-use format, but by importing the findings\\nmost relevant to her work into her notes, she can add as many annotations and\\ncomments as she wants. The  second  way  that  people  use  their  Second  Brain  is  to  connect  ideas\\ntogether. Their  Second  Brain  evolves  from  being  primarily  a memory  tool  to\\nbecoming a thinking tool. A piece of advice from a mentor comes in handy as they\\nencounter a similar situation on a different team. An illuminating metaphor from\\na  book  finds  its  way  into  a  presentation  they’re  delivering. The  ideas  they’ve\\ncaptured begin gravitating toward each other and cross-pollinating. Fernando is an oncologist at a world-renowned hospital who uses his Second\\nBrain  to  organize  his  patient  notes. He  summarizes  the  key  points  from  each\\npatient’s  health  history  with  a  special  focus  on  how  long  they’ve  had  the\\ncondition,  which  treatments  they’ve  received,  and  key  features  of  their  tumor. Fernando uses his Second Brain to connect what he knows from his training and\\nresearch to the needs of his patients, to be able to treat them more effectively. Eventually, the third and final way that people use their Second Brain is for\\ncreating new things. They realize that they have a lot of knowledge on a subject\\nand  decide  to  turn  it  into  something  concrete  and  shareable. Seeing  so  much\\nsupporting material ready and waiting gives them the courage to put their own\\nideas out there and have a positive impact on others. Terrell  is  a  young  father  of  three  working  a  demanding  job  at  a  large  tech\\ncompany in Texas. After taking my course, he used his Second Brain to start a\\nYouTube channel where he shares stories and tips on parenting. For example, he’s\\nmade  videos  on  how  to  travel  internationally  with  kids  and  how  to  request\\npaternity leave, and shared clips from weekend trips he’s taken with his family. Being able to keep track of all the video ideas and production details outside his\\nhead has been crucial in allowing Terrell to balance his side gig with his full-time\\ncareer, while still having enough time with his kids. He is using his Second Brain\\nto express himself and create the content he wants to see in the world. Each of these individuals has leveraged technology to remember, connect, and\\ncreate far more effectively than if they had to do it on their own. 8\\n They use their\\nSecond Brain in ways that complement the current season of their lives. As those\\n\\nseasons change, they will be able to adapt how they use their notes so that they\\nremain relevant and useful.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"3758381a-1f7f-4a70-8667-15e087408b62":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3758381a-1f7f-4a70-8667-15e087408b62\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"bf8fed3a-167f-4de2-a499-21d20f973920\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ce4cccc5-aa46-4a96-aeda-870c8f39950e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Introducing The CODE Method: The Four Steps to\\nRemembering What Matters\\nTo guide you in the process of creating your own Second Brain, I’ve developed a\\nsimple, intuitive four-part method called “CODE”—Capture; Organize; Distill;\\nExpress. These are the steps not only to build your Second Brain in the first place, but\\nalso  to  work  with  it  going  forward. Each  of  these  steps  represents  a  timeless\\nprinciple found throughout humanity’s history, from the earliest cave paintings\\nto  the  artisan  workshops  of  the  Renaissance  to  the  most  cutting-edge  modern\\nfields. They are flexible and agnostic for any profession, role, or career and for\\nwhatever notetaking methods and platforms you prefer. I’m even willing to bet\\nthat you’re doing them already in some form, whether you realize it or not. CODE is a map for navigating the endless streams of information we are now\\nfaced with every day. It is a modern approach to creating a commonplace book,\\nadapted to the needs of the Information Age. The same way we have a genetic code that determines our height and eye color,\\nwe also have a creative code that is hardwired into our imagination. It shapes how\\nwe think and how we interact with the world. It is mirrored in the software code\\nthat runs the apps we use to handle information. It’s also been a secret code for\\nmost of history—now it’s finally time to reveal how it works. III\\n\\nLet’s  preview  each  of  the  four  steps  of  the  CODE  Method—Capture,\\nOrganize,  Distill,  and  Express—and  then  we’ll  dive  into  the  details  in  the\\nfollowing chapters. Capture: Keep What Resonates\\nEvery  time  we  turn  on  our  smartphone  or  computer,  we  are  immediately\\nimmersed in the flow of juicy content they present. Much of this information is\\nuseful  and  interesting—how-to  articles  that  could  make  us  more  productive,\\npodcasts  with  experts  sharing  hard-won  lessons,  or  inspiring  photos  of  travel\\ndestinations we might want to visit. Here’s the problem: we can’t consume every bit of this information stream. We will quickly be exhausted and overwhelmed if we try. We need to adopt the\\nperspective of a curator, stepping back from the raging river and starting to make\\nintentional decisions about what information we want to fill our minds. Like a scientist capturing only the rarest butterflies to take back to the lab, our\\ngoal  should  be  to  “capture”  only  the  ideas  and  insights  we  think  are  truly\\nnoteworthy. Content  tends  to  pile  up  all  around  us  even  without  our\\ninvolvement. There are probably emails filling your inbox, updates popping up in\\nyour  social  media  feeds,  and  notifications  proliferating  on  your  smartphone  as\\nyou’re reading this. It’s already there, but we tend to capture it haphazardly, at best. You might\\nemail yourself a quick note, brainstorm some ideas in a document, or highlight\\nquotes  in  a  book  you’re  reading,  but  that  information  probably  remains\\ndisconnected and scattered. The insights you uncovered through serious mental\\neffort remain hidden in forgotten folders or drifting in the cloud. The solution is to keep only what resonates in a trusted place that you control,\\nand to leave the rest aside. When something resonates, it moves you on an intuitive level. Often, the ideas\\nthat resonate are the ones that are most unusual, counterintuitive, interesting, or\\npotentially useful. Don’t make it an analytical decision, and don’t worry about\\nwhy  exactly  it  resonates—just  look  inside  for  a  feeling  of  pleasure,  curiosity,\\n\\nwonder, or excitement, and let that be your signal for when it’s time to capture a\\npassage, an image, a quote, or a fact.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ce4cccc5-aa46-4a96-aeda-870c8f39950e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ce4cccc5-aa46-4a96-aeda-870c8f39950e\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"3758381a-1f7f-4a70-8667-15e087408b62\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"a9fd8b7f-c53f-4ca5-a5c6-37bf35461580\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"By  training  ourselves  to  notice  when  something  resonates  with  us,  we  can\\nimprove not only our ability to take better notes, but also our understanding of\\nourselves and what makes us tick. It is a way of turning up the volume on our\\nintuition so we can hear the wisdom it offers us. Adopting  the  habit  of  knowledge  capture  has  immediate  benefits  for  our\\nmental health and peace of mind. We can let go of the fear that our memory will\\nfail  us  at  a  crucial  moment. Instead  of  jumping  at  every  new  headline  and\\nnotification, we can choose to consume information that adds value to our lives\\nand consciously let go of the rest. Organize: Save for Actionability\\nOnce you’ve begun capturing notes with the ideas that resonate with you, you’ll\\neventually feel the need to organize them. It is tempting to try to create a perfect hierarchy of folders up front to contain\\nevery possible note you might ever want to capture. Even if it was possible, that\\napproach would be incredibly time-consuming and require way too much effort,\\npulling you away from what interests you today. Most people tend to organize information by subject, like the Dewey decimal\\nsystem you’ve probably seen at the library. For example, you might find a book\\nunder  a  broad  subject  category  like  “Architecture,”  “Business,”  “History,”  or\\n“Geology.” When it comes to digital notes, we can use much easier and lighter ways of\\norganizing. Because our priorities and goals can change at a moment’s notice, and\\nprobably  will,  we  want  to  avoid  organizing  methods  that  are  overly  rigid  and\\nprescriptive. The  best  way  to  organize  your  notes  is  to organize  for  action,\\naccording  to  the  active  projects  you  are  working  on  right  now. Consider  new\\ninformation in terms of its utility, asking, “How is this going to help me move\\nforward one of my current projects?” Surprisingly, when you focus on taking action, the vast amount of information\\nout there gets radically streamlined and simplified. There are relatively few things\\n\\nthat are actionable and relevant at any given time, which means you have a clear\\nfilter for ignoring everything else. Organizing  for  action  gives  you  a  sense  of  tremendous  clarity,  because  you\\nknow  that  everything  you’re  keeping  actually  has  a  purpose. You  know  that  it\\naligns with your goals and priorities. Instead of organizing being an obstacle to\\nyour productivity, it becomes a contributor to it. Distill: Find the Essence\\nOnce you start capturing ideas in a central place and organizing them for action,\\nyou’ll inevitably begin to notice patterns and connections between them. An article you read about gardening will give you an insight into growing your\\ncustomer  base. An  offhand  testimonial  from  a  client  will  give  you  the  idea  to\\ncreate a web page with all your client testimonials. A business card will remind\\nyou of a fascinating conversation you had with someone who you could reach out\\nto for coffee. The  human  mind  is  like  a  sizzling-hot  frying  pan  of  associations—throw  a\\nhandful of seeds in there and they’ll explode into new ideas like popcorn. Every\\nnote is the seed of an idea, reminding you of what you already know and already\\nthink about a topic. There  is  a  powerful  way  to  facilitate  and  speed  up  this  process  of  rapid\\nassociation: distill your notes down to their essence. Every  idea  has  an  “essence”:  the  heart  and  soul  of  what  it  is  trying  to\\ncommunicate. It might take hundreds of pages and thousands of words to fully\\nexplain a complex insight, but there is always a way to convey the core message in\\njust a sentence or two.

Every time you take a note, ask yourself, “How can I make this as useful as\\npossible for my future self?” That question will lead you to annotate the words\\nand phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and what\\nexactly caught your attention. Your notes will be useless if you can’t decipher them in the future, or if they’re\\nso long that you don’t even try. Think of yourself not just as a taker of notes, but\\nas a giver of notes—you are giving your future self the gift of knowledge that is\\neasy to find and understand. Express: Show Your Work\\nAll the previous steps—capturing, organizing, and distilling—are geared toward\\none  ultimate  purpose:  sharing  your  own  ideas,  your  own  story,  and  your  own\\nknowledge with others. What is the point of knowledge if it doesn’t help anyone or produce anything? IV\\n  Whether  your  goal  is  to  lose  weight,  get  a  promotion  at  work,  start  a  side\\nbusiness, or strengthen your local community, personal knowledge management\\nexists to support taking action—anything else is a distraction. A common challenge for people who are curious and love to learn is that we\\ncan  fall  into  the  habit  of  continuously  force-feeding  ourselves  more  and  more\\ninformation, but never actually take the next step and apply it. We compile tons\\nof research, but never put forward our own proposal. We gather untold business\\ncase  studies,  but  never  pitch  one  potential  client. We  study  every  piece  of\\nrelationship advice available, but never ask anyone out on a date. It’s  so  easy  to  endlessly  delay  and  postpone  the  experiences  that  would  so\\nenrich our lives. We think we’re not ready. We fear we’re not prepared. We cannot\\nstand the thought that there is one little piece of information we’re missing that, if\\nwe had it, would make all the difference. I’m here to tell you that that is no way to live your life. Information becomes\\nknowledge—personal, embodied, verified—only when we put it to use. You gain\\nconfidence in what you know only when you know that it works. Until you do,\\nit’s just a theory. This is why I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible\\nfrom consuming to creating. V\\n We all naturally have a desire to create—to bring to\\nlife  something  good,  true,  or  beautiful. 9\\n  It’s  a  part  of  our  essential  nature. Creating new things is not only one of the most deeply fulfilling things we can do,\\nit  can  also  have  a  positive  impact  on  others—by  inspiring,  entertaining,  or\\neducating them. What should you create? It depends on your skills, interests, and personality. If you are highly analytical,\\nyou  could  evaluate  the  many  options  for  camping  gear  and  create  a  list  of\\nrecommended products to share with your friends. If you like to teach, you could\\nrecord your favorite dessert recipe and post it on social media or a blog. If you care\\nabout a local cause such as public parks, you could create a plan to lobby the city\\ncouncil for more funding.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"aaed338a-5849-4aa6-b8d5-0565163b561e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"aaed338a-5849-4aa6-b8d5-0565163b561e\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a9fd8b7f-c53f-4ca5-a5c6-37bf35461580\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"7499bfbd-676a-490e-a91b-19141eca602a\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"All  these  actions—evaluate,  share,  teach,  record,  post,  and  lobby\\nVI\\n—are\\nsynonyms  for  the  act  of  expression.

Information is always in flux, and it is always a work in progress. Since nothing\\nis ever truly final, there is no need to wait to get started. You can publish a simple\\nwebsite now, and slowly add additional pages over time. You can send out a draft\\nof a piece of writing now and make revisions later when you have more time. The\\nsooner you begin, the sooner you start on the path of improvement. I’ve introduced a lot of new concepts and terms, and I know at this point it can\\nseem a little overwhelming. It may feel like you have to learn and do a lot of new\\nthings to be able to build a Second Brain. Here’s the surprising truth: you are already doing most of the work required. You are already learning new things—you couldn’t stop if you wanted to. You\\nalready consume interesting ideas—note the dozens of tabs you likely have open\\nin  your  browser. You  already  put  in  so  much  effort  to  keep  track  of  all  the\\n\\ninformation you need for your studies, your job, or your business. All you need is\\na slightly more intentional, more deliberate way to manage that information, plus\\na few practical habits to ensure it gets done. In Part Two, I will show you how to use the CODE steps to radically expand\\nyour memory, intelligence, and creativity. For each step, I’ll share a set of practical\\ntechniques  that  you  can  implement  today  that  will  begin  to  yield  benefits\\ntomorrow. Techniques  that  don’t  require  any  advanced  technology—only  the\\neveryday devices and apps you have in your pocket and on your desk right now. I. Many people who follow the CODE methodology continue to use paper for their notes. Many even find\\nthat they take more notes on paper once they have a way of capturing those notes digitally and saving them in\\na secure place. It’s not black-or-white. It’s about choosing the right tool for the job. This book is focused\\nprimarily on the potential of digital notes. II. Most notes apps provide ways of exporting your notes in standard formats that can then be imported into\\nother apps. I personally have switched platforms twice (from Microsoft Word to Google Docs, and then later\\nto Evernote) and expect to switch to new platforms regularly in the future as technology advances. III. In a wonderful coincidence, recent research by neurophysiologists May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser at\\nthe Norwegian University of Science and Technology indicates that the human brain remembers information\\nusing a “grid code”—a part of the brain involved in spatial reasoning. They speculate that “the grid code\\ncould therefore be some sort of metric or coordinate system” that can “uniquely and efficiently represent a lot\\nof information.” IV. The word “productivity” has the same origin as the Latin verb producere, which means “to produce.” Which means that at the end of the day, if you can’t point to some kind of output or result you’ve produced,\\nit’s questionable whether you’ve been productive at all. V. The consumerist attitude toward information—that more is better, that we never have enough, and that\\nwhat we already have isn’t good enough—is at the heart of many people’s dissatisfaction with how they spend\\ntheir time online. Instead of trying to find “the best” content, I recommend instead switching your focus to\\nmaking things, which is far more satisfying. VI. Other synonyms for expression include publish, speak, present, perform, produce, write, draw, interpret,\\ncritique, or translate.

Building a Private Collection of Knowledge\\nTaylor Swift is an icon of modern pop and country music and one of the best-\\nselling music artists in history. Her nine chart-topping albums have sold over two\\nhundred million copies worldwide and earned her a long list of awards, including\\neleven Grammy Awards. Not only does she appear in lists of the greatest singer-\\nsongwriters of all time, her influence has transcended music and placed her on\\nsuch lists as the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. 1\\nOver  the  course  of  her  career,  Swift  has  released  five  documentary  films\\nrevealing her creative songwriting process. In all of them, she can be found with\\nher head buried in her phone. As she says: “I disappear into my phone because my\\nphone is where I keep my notes and my phone is where I’m editing.” 2\\n In her notes\\nshe can write down (and reread, edit, and riff off) any snippet of lyrics or melodic\\nhook that flickers through her mind. She can take her notes everywhere, access\\nthem  from  anywhere,  and  send  them  within  seconds  to  a  wide  network  of\\nproducers and collaborators using the same device. Any feedback they send back\\ncan go right into her notes as well. In an interview about how she wrote the smash hit “Blank Space,”\\n3\\n Swift says,\\n“I’ll be going about my daily life and I’ll think, ‘Wow, so we only have two real\\noptions  in  relationships—it’s  going  to  be  forever  or  it’s  going  to  go  down  in\\nflames,’ so I’ll jot that down in my notes... I’ll come up with a line that I think is\\nclever like ‘Darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream’ and I just pick them\\nand put them where they fit and construct the bridge out of more lines that come\\nup within the last couple of years... ‘Blank Space’ was the culmination of all my\\nbest ones one after the other.” For Swift, writing songs is not a discrete activity that she can do only at certain\\ntimes and in certain places.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"99361eb7-db7c-4ed1-bc77-eead70136189":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"99361eb7-db7c-4ed1-bc77-eead70136189\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"7499bfbd-676a-490e-a91b-19141eca602a\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"38f3b03a-7521-4a7c-95e0-2730b9c7cb27\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"It is a side effect of the way her mind works, spinning\\noff  new  metaphors  and  turns  of  phrase  at  the  most  unexpected  times:  “I’m\\ninspired to write songs at any time of day, when I’m going through something or\\nwhen the dust has settled and I’m over it. It can be anything. I’ll just be doing\\ndishes or something, or in the middle of an interview, and I could get an idea in\\nmy head that just kind of sticks out as, ‘That could be a hook, that could be a pre-\\nchorus, that’s a first line.’ ” She goes on to explain why it’s so important to her to\\ncapture those fleeting thoughts right as they appear: “I kind of have to capitalize\\non the excitement of me getting that idea and see it all the way through or else I’ll\\nleave it behind and assume it wasn’t good enough.” Even after all her success, even Taylor Swift needs a system to carry her ideas\\nfrom inception all the way to completion. By integrating her notetaking with her\\ndaily  life,  she’s  able  to  use  language  and analogies  that  are  rooted  in  everyday\\nfeelings and experiences, forging a powerful connection with her fans who call\\nthemselves “Swifties.” Listening to her albums is like following Swift on a journey\\nof self-discovery, each album chronicling what she was experiencing and who she\\nwas becoming in each chapter of her life. This story sheds light on how even the world’s most successful and prolific\\ncreatives need support systems to pursue their craft. It’s not a matter of having\\nenough  raw  talent. Talent  needs  to  be  channeled  and  developed  in  order  to\\nbecome  something  more  than  a  momentary  spark. Actor  and  comedian  Jerry\\nSeinfeld, arguably the most influential comedian of his generation, wrote in his\\nbook Is This Anything? :\\nWhenever  I  came  up  with  a  funny  bit,  whether  it  happened  on  a  stage,  in  a\\nconversation  or  working  it  out  on  my  preferred  canvas,  the  big  yellow  legal\\npad, I kept it in one of those old-school accordion folders... A lot of people I’ve\\ntalked  to  seemed  surprised  that  I’ve  kept  all  these  notes. I  don’t  understand\\nwhy  they  think  that. I  don’t  understand  why  I’ve  kept  anything  else. What\\ncould possibly be of more value? Think about your favorite athlete, musician, or actor. Behind the scenes of their\\npublic persona, there is a process they follow for regularly turning new ideas into\\ncreative  output. The  same  goes  for  inventors,  engineers,  and  effective  leaders. Innovation and impact don’t happen by accident or chance. Creativity depends\\non a creative process. Creating a Knowledge Bank: How to Generate Compounding\\nInterest from Your Thoughts\\nIn  Chapter  2,  we  looked  at  the  history  of  commonplace  books,  kept  by\\nintellectuals  and  writers  in  previous  centuries.

Knowing how they were going to be putting ideas to use gave them a powerful\\nlens for seeing which ones were worth the trouble of writing down. This  practice  continues  among  creatives  today. Songwriters  are  known  for\\ncompiling “hook books” full of lyrics and musical riffs they may want to use in\\nfuture songs. Software engineers build “code libraries” so useful bits of code are\\neasy to access. Lawyers keep “case files” with details from past cases they might\\nwant to refer to in the future.

To  answer  that  question,  we  have  to  radically  expand  our  definition  of\\n“knowledge.” Knowledge isn’t  just  wise  quotations  from  long-dead  Greek  philosophers  in\\nwhite togas.

At other times that\\nknowledge is lofty and grand—your in-depth notes from a book on history that\\ncould  change  how  you  think  about  the  world. Or  anything  in  between. A\\nknowledge asset is anything that can be used in the future to solve a problem, save\\ntime, illuminate a concept, or learn from past experience. Knowledge  assets  can  come  from  either  the  external  world  or  your  inner\\nthoughts. External knowledge could include:\\nHighlights: Insightful passages from books or articles you read.

Images: Photos or other images that you find inspiring or interesting. Takeaways:  Lessons  from  courses,  conferences,  or  presentations  you’ve\\nattended. Look around you and notice that you already have many of these. It may be\\ndisorganized,  spread  around  in  different  places,  and  saved  in  different  formats,\\nbut it’s there.

The content\\nyou save in your notes is easily accessible from any device, which is great for\\naccessibility but not for security. Information like tax records, government\\ndocuments, passwords, and health records shouldn’t be saved in your notes. Is this a special format or file type better handled by a dedicated\\napp? Although you could save specialized files such as Photoshop files or\\nvideo  footage  in  your  notes,  you’ll  need  a  specialized  app  to  open  them\\nanyway, so there’s no benefit to keeping them in your notes. Is this a very large file? Notes apps are made for short, lightweight bits of\\ntext and images, and their performance will often be severely hampered if\\nyou try to save large files in them. Will it need to be collaboratively edited? Notes apps are perfectly suited\\nfor  individual,  private  use,  which  makes  them  less  than  ideal  for\\ncollaboration. You can share individual notes or even groups of notes with\\nothers, but if you need multiple people to be able to collaboratively edit a\\ndocument in real time, then you’ll need to use a different platform. Twelve Favorite Problems: A Nobel Prize Winner’s Approach\\nto Capturing\\nWith the abundance of content all around us, it can be hard to know exactly what\\nis worth preserving. I use an insightful exercise to help people make this decision\\n\\neasier. I  call  it  “Twelve  Favorite  Problems,”  inspired  by  Nobel  Prize–winning\\nphysicist Richard Feynman. Feynman was known for his wide-ranging, eclectic tastes. As a child he already\\nshowed a talent for engineering, once building a functioning home alarm system\\nout of spare parts while his parents were out running errands. During his colorful\\nlifetime Feynman spent time in Brazil teaching physics, learned to play the bongo\\nand the conga drums well enough to perform with orchestras, and enthusiastically\\ntraveled around the world exploring other cultures. Of  course,  Feynman  is  best  known  for  his  groundbreaking  discoveries  in\\ntheoretical  physics  and  quantum  mechanics,  for  which  he  received  the  Nobel\\nPrize in 1965. In his spare time, he also played a pivotal role on the commission\\nthat investigated the Challenger space shuttle disaster and published half a dozen\\nbooks. How  could  one  person  make  so  many  contributions  across  so  many  areas? How  did  he  have  the  time  to  lead  such  a  full  and  interesting  life  while  also\\nbecoming one of the most recognized scientists of his generation? Feynman revealed his strategy in an interview\\n4\\n:\\nYou have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your\\nmind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9f124ff5-15d1-4364-be19-7eae88432e9f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9f124ff5-15d1-4364-be19-7eae88432e9f\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"ff6e94ae-b245-4058-aa33-c37220835092\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"32b36347-a5f1-408f-b288-ca8b3b8fa739\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Every time you\\nhear  or  read  a  new  trick  or  a  new  result,  test  it  against  each  of  your  twelve\\nproblems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and\\npeople will say, “How did he do it? He must be a genius!” In  other  words,  Feynman’s  approach  was  to  maintain  a  list  of  a  dozen  open\\nquestions. When a new scientific finding came out, he would test it against each\\nof  his  questions  to  see  if  it  shed  any  new  light  on  the  problem. This  cross-\\ndisciplinary  approach  allowed  him  to  make  connections  across  seemingly\\nunrelated subjects, while continuing to follow his sense of curiosity. As told in Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick,\\n5\\nFeynman once took inspiration for his physics from an accident at dinner:\\n\\n... he  was  eating  in  the  student  cafeteria  when  someone  tossed  a  dinner  plate\\ninto  the  air—a  Cornell  cafeteria  plate  with  the university  seal  imprinted  on\\none  rim—and  in  the  instant  of  its  flight  he  experienced  what  he  long\\nafterward  considered  an  epiphany. As  the  plate  spun,  it  wobbled. Because  of\\nthe  insignia  he  could  see  that  the  spin  and  the  wobble  were  not  quite  in\\nsynchrony. Yet  just  in  that  instant  it  seemed  to  him—or  was  it  his  physicist’s\\nintuition? —that the two rotations were related. After  working  the  problem  out  on  paper,  Feynman  discovered  a  2-to-1  ratio\\nbetween the plate’s wobble and spin, a neat relationship that suggested a deeper\\nunderlying principle at work. When a fellow physicist and mentor asked what the use of such an insight was,\\nFeynman  responded:  “It  doesn’t  have  any  importance... I  don’t  care  whether  a\\nthing has importance. Isn’t it fun?” He was following his intuition and curiosity. But  it  did  end  up  having  importance,  with  his  research  into  the  equations\\nunderlying rotation informing the work that ultimately led to him receiving the\\nNobel Prize. Feynman’s  approach  encouraged  him  to  follow  his  interests  wherever  they\\nmight  lead. He  posed  questions  and  constantly  scanned  for  solutions  to  long-\\nstanding  problems  in  his  reading,  conversations,  and  everyday  life. When  he\\nfound  one,  he  could  make  a  connection  that  looked  to  others  like  a  flash  of\\nunparalleled brilliance. Ask  yourself,  “What  are  the  questions  I’ve  always  been  interested  in?” This\\ncould include grand, sweeping questions like “How can we make society fairer\\nand more equitable?” as well as practical ones like “How can I make it a habit to\\nexercise every day?” It might include questions about relationships, such as “How\\ncan I have closer relationships with the people I love?” or productivity, like “How\\ncan I spend more of my time doing high-value work?” Here are more examples of favorite problems from my students:\\nHow do I live less in the past, and more in the present? How do I build an investment strategy that is aligned with my mid-term\\nand long-term goals and commitments? What  does  it  look  like  to  move  from  mindless  consumption  to  mindful\\ncreation? How can I go to bed early instead of watching shows after the kids go to\\nbed? How  can  my  industry  become  more  ecologically  sustainable  while\\nremaining profitable?

Some  express  deep  longings,  while  others  are  more  like  spontaneous  interests. Many are questions about how to live a better life, while a few are focused on how\\nto  succeed  professionally. The  key  to  this  exercise  is  to  make  them open-ended\\nquestions  that  don’t  necessarily  have  a  single  answer. To  find  questions  that\\ninvoke a state of wonder and curiosity about the amazing world we live in. The power of your favorite problems is that they tend to stay fairly consistent\\nover time. The exact framing of each question may change, but even as we move\\nbetween projects, jobs, relationships, and careers, our favorite problems tend to\\nfollow us across the years. I recommend asking your family or childhood friends\\nwhat you were obsessed with as a kid. Those very same interests probably still fire\\nyour  imagination  as  an  adult. Which  means  any  content  you  collect  related  to\\nthem will likely be relevant far into the future as well. As  a  kid,  I  had  a  passion  for  LEGOs,  the  modular  toy  blocks  beloved  by\\ngenerations of children. My parents noticed that I didn’t play with LEGOs like\\nother  kids. Instead  I  spent  my  time  organizing  and  reorganizing  the  pieces. I\\nremember being completely captivated by the problem of how to create order out\\nof the chaos of thousands of pieces of every shape and size. I would invent new\\norganizational schemes—by color, by size, by theme—as I became obsessed with\\nthe idea that if I could just find the right system, I would finally be able to build\\nmy magnum opus—a LEGO spaceship like the ones I saw in the sci-fi movies I\\nloved. That  very  same  question—How  can  creativity  emerge  out  of  chaos? —still\\ndrives me to this day. Only now, it’s in the form of organizing digital information\\ninstead of LEGOs. Pursuing this question has taught me so many things over the\\nyears,  across  many  seasons  of  my  life. The  goal  isn’t  to  definitively  answer  the\\nquestion once and for all, but to use the question as a North Star for my learning. Take a moment now to write down some of your own favorite problems. Here\\nare my recommendations to guide you:\\nAsk people close to you what you were obsessed with as a child (often you’ll\\ncontinue to be fascinated with the same things as an adult). Don’t  worry  about  coming  up  with  exactly  twelve  (the  exact  number\\ndoesn’t matter, but try to come up with at least a few). Don’t worry about getting the list perfect (this is just a first pass, and it will\\nalways be evolving). Phrase them as open-ended questions that could have multiple answers (in\\ncontrast to “yes/no” questions with only one answer). Use your list of favorite problems to make decisions about what to capture:\\nanything potentially relevant to answering them. Use one of the capture tools I\\nrecommend  later  in  this  chapter,  or  in  the  Second  Brain  Resource  Guide  at\\nBuildingasecondbrain. com/resources. Capture Criteria: How to Avoid Keeping Too Much (or Too\\nLittle)\\nOnce you have identified the kinds of questions you want your Second Brain to\\nanswer, it’s time to choose specifically which pieces of information will be most\\nuseful. Imagine you come across a blog post during your web browsing that details\\nhow a marketing expert you respect runs her campaigns. You’re hooked: this is the\\nkind of material you’ve been looking for! Finally, the master reveals her secrets!\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"781b71b1-c319-4739-88c5-baaa11b5ba0b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"781b71b1-c319-4739-88c5-baaa11b5ba0b\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"32b36347-a5f1-408f-b288-ca8b3b8fa739\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"98923c73-1961-48ab-addd-4659356f094a\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Finally, the master reveals her secrets! Your first instinct might be to save the article in its entirety. It’s high-quality\\ninformation, so why not preserve all of it? The problem is, it’s an in-depth how-to\\narticle that is thousands of words long. Even if you spend the twenty or thirty\\nminutes it would take to consume it now, in the future you’ll just have to spend\\nall that time reading it again, since you’ll have forgotten most of the details. You\\nalso don’t want to just bookmark the link and save it to read later, because then\\nyou won’t know what it contains in the first place! This  is  where  most  people  get  stuck. They  either  dive  straight  into  the  first\\npiece of content they see, read it voraciously, but quickly forget all the details, or\\nthey open dozens of tabs in their web browser and feel a pang of guilt at all those\\ninteresting resources they haven’t been able to get to. There is a way out of this situation. It starts with realizing that in any piece of\\ncontent, the value is not evenly distributed. There are always certain parts that are\\nespecially  interesting,  helpful,  or  valuable  to  you. When  you  realize  this,  the\\nanswer is obvious. You can extract only the most salient, relevant, rich material\\nand save it as a succinct note. Don’t  save  entire  chapters  of  a  book—save  only  select  passages. Don’t  save\\ncomplete  transcripts  of  interviews—save  a  few  of  the  best  quotes. Don’t  save\\nentire websites—save a few screenshots of the sections that are most interesting. The best curators are picky about what they allow into their collections, and you\\nshould be too. With a notes app, you can always save links back to the original\\ncontent if you need to review your sources or want to dive deeper into the details\\nin the future. The biggest pitfall I see people falling into once they begin capturing digital\\nnotes  is  saving  too  much. If  you  try  to  save  every  piece  of  material  you  come\\nacross,  you  run  the  risk  of  inundating  your  future  self  with  tons  of  irrelevant\\ninformation. At  that  point,  your  Second  Brain  will  be  no  better  than  scrolling\\nthrough social media. This is why it’s so important to take on a Curator’s Perspective—that we are\\nthe judges, editors, and interpreters of the information we choose to let into our\\nlives. Thinking  like  a  curator  means  taking  charge  of  your  own  information\\nstream, instead of just letting it wash over you. The more economical you can be\\nwith the material you capture in the first place, the less time and effort your future\\nself will have to spend organizing, distilling, and expressing it. II\\nHere are four criteria I suggest to help you decide exactly which nuggets of\\nknowledge are worth keeping:\\nCapture Criteria #1: Does It Inspire Me? Inspiration  is  one  of  the  most  rare  and  precious  experiences  in  life. It  is  the\\nessential fuel for doing your best work, yet it’s impossible to call up inspiration on\\ndemand. You can Google the answer to a question, but you can’t Google a feeling. There is a way to evoke a sense of inspiration more regularly: keep a collection\\nof inspiring quotes, photos, ideas, and stories. Any time you need a break, a new\\nperspective, or a dash of motivation, you can look through it and see what sparks\\nyour imagination. For example, I keep a folder full of customer testimonials I’ve received over the\\nyears. Any time I think what I’m doing doesn’t matter or isn’t good enough, all I\\nhave to do is open up that folder and my perspective is completely shifted. Capture Criteria #2: Is It Useful? Carpenters are known for keeping odds and ends in a corner of their workshop—\\na variety of nails and washers, scraps of lumber cut off from larger planks, and\\nrandom bits of metal and wood.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"98923c73-1961-48ab-addd-4659356f094a":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"98923c73-1961-48ab-addd-4659356f094a\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"781b71b1-c319-4739-88c5-baaa11b5ba0b\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ba1eedc3-754f-4286-a428-303fb98cbef0\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"It costs nothing to keep these “offcuts” around,\\n\\nand  surprisingly  often  they  end  up  being  the  crucial  missing  piece  in  a  future\\nproject. Sometimes  you  come  across  a  piece  of  information  that  isn’t  necessarily\\ninspiring,  but  you  know  it  might  come  in  handy  in  the  future. A  statistic,  a\\nreference, a research finding, or a helpful diagram—these are the equivalents of\\nthe spare parts a carpenter might keep around their workshop. For example, I keep a folder full of stock photos, graphics, and drawings I find\\nboth online and offline. Any time I need an image for a slide deck, or a web page,\\nor  to  spark  new  ideas,  I  have  a  plentiful  supply  of  imagery  I’ve  already  found\\ncompelling ready and waiting. Capture Criteria #3: Is It Personal? One of the most valuable kinds of information to keep is personal information—\\nyour  own  thoughts,  reflections,  memories,  and  mementos. Like  the  age-old\\npractice of journaling or keeping a diary, we can use notetaking to document our\\nlives and better understand how we became who we are. No one else has access to the wisdom you’ve personally gained from a lifetime\\nof conversations, mistakes, victories, and lessons learned. No one else values the\\nsmall moments of your days quite like you do. I often save screenshots of text messages sent between my family and friends. The small moments of warmth and humor that take place in these threads are\\nprecious  to  me,  since  I  can’t  always  be  with  them  in  person. It  takes  mere\\nmoments,  and  I  love  knowing  that  I’ll  forever  have  memories  from  my\\nconversations with the people closest to me. Capture Criteria #4: Is It Surprising? I’ve often noticed that many of the notes people take are of ideas they already\\nknow, already agree with, or could have guessed. We have a natural bias as humans\\nto  seek  evidence  that  confirms  what  we  already  believe,  a  well-studied\\nphenomenon known as “confirmation bias.” 6\\n\\nThat  isn’t  what  a  Second  Brain  is  for. The  renowned  information  theorist\\nClaude Shannon, whose discoveries paved the way for modern technology, had a\\nsimple  definition  for  “information”:  that  which  surprises  you. 7\\n  If  you’re  not\\nsurprised, then you already knew it at some level, so why take note of it? Surprise\\nis an excellent barometer for information that doesn’t fit neatly into our existing\\nunderstanding, which means it has the potential to change how we think. Sometimes  you  come  across  an  idea  that  is  neither  inspiring,  personal,  nor\\nobviously useful, but there is something surprising about it. You may not be able\\nto put your finger on why, but it conflicts with your existing point of view in a\\nway that makes your brain perk up and pay attention. Those are the ideas you\\nshould capture. Your  Second  Brain  shouldn’t  be  just  another  way  of  confirming  what  you\\nalready know. We are already surrounded by algorithms that feed us only what we\\nalready  believe  and  social  networks  that  continually  reinforce  what  we  already\\nthink. Our ability to capture ideas from anywhere takes us in a different direction: By\\nsaving ideas that may contradict each other and don’t necessarily support what we\\nalready  believe,  we  can  train  ourselves  to  take  in  information  from  different\\nsources instead of immediately jumping to conclusions. By playing with ideas—\\nbending and stretching and remixing them—we become less attached to the way\\nthey were originally presented and can borrow certain aspects or elements to use\\nin our own work. If what you’re capturing doesn’t change your mind, then what’s the point?\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ba1eedc3-754f-4286-a428-303fb98cbef0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ba1eedc3-754f-4286-a428-303fb98cbef0\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"98923c73-1961-48ab-addd-4659356f094a\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"72fa30b7-e892-44c9-8d00-dadf17d8e335\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Ultimately, Capture What Resonates\\nI’ve given you specific criteria to help you decide what is worth capturing, but if\\nyou take away one thing from this chapter, it should be to keep what resonates. Here’s  why:  making  decisions  analytically,  with  a  checklist,  is  taxing  and\\nstressful. It is the kind of thinking that demands the most energy. When you use\\nup too much energy taking notes, you have little left over for the subsequent steps\\nthat add far more value: making connections, imagining possibilities, formulating\\n\\ntheories,  and  creating  new  ideas  of  your  own. Not  to  mention,  if  you  make\\nreading and learning into unpleasant experiences, over time you’re going to find\\nyourself doing less and less of them. The secret to making reading a habit is to\\nmake it effortless and enjoyable. As  you  consume  a  piece  of  content,  listen  for  an  internal  feeling  of  being\\nmoved  or  surprised  by  the  idea  you’re  taking  in. This  special  feeling  of\\n“resonance”—like  an  echo  in  your  soul—is  your  intuition  telling  you  that\\nsomething is literally “noteworthy.” You don’t need to figure out exactly why it\\nresonates. Just look for the signs: your eyes might widen slightly, your heart may\\nskip a beat, your throat may go slightly dry, and your sense of time might subtly\\nslow down as the world around you fades away. These are clues that it’s time to\\nhit “save.” We know from neuroscientific research that “emotions organize—rather than\\ndisrupt—rational  thinking.” 8\\n  When  something  resonates  with  us,  it  is  our\\nemotion-based, intuitive mind telling us it is interesting before our logical mind\\ncan explain why. I often find that a piece of content resonates with me in ways I\\ncan’t fully explain in the moment, and its true potential only becomes clear later\\non. There’s scientific evidence that our intuition knows what it’s doing. From the\\nbook Designing for Behavior Change:\\n9\\nParticipants  in  a  famous  study  were  given  four  biased  decks  of  cards—some\\nthat would win them money, and some that would cause them to lose. When\\nthey  started  the  game,  they  didn’t  know  that  the  decks  were  biased. As  they\\nplayed  the  game,  though,  people’s  bodies  started  showing  signs  of  physical\\n“stress” when their conscious minds were about to use a money-losing deck. The\\nstress  was  an  automatic  response  that  occurred  because  the intuitive  mind\\nrealized  something  was  wrong—long  before  the  conscious  mind  realized\\nanything was amiss. The authors’ conclusion: “Our intuitive mind learns, and responds, even without\\nour conscious awareness.” If you ignore that inner voice of intuition, over time it will slowly quiet down\\nand fade away. If you practice listening to what it is telling you, the inner voice\\nwill grow stronger. You’ll start to hear it in all kinds of situations. It will guide you\\nin what choices to make and which opportunities to pursue. It will warn you away\\nfrom people and situations that aren’t right for you. It will speak up and take a\\nstand for your convictions even when you’re afraid. I can’t think of anything more important for your creative life—and your life\\nin general—than learning to listen to the voice of intuition inside. It is the source\\nof  your  imagination,  your  confidence,  and  your  spontaneity. You  can\\nintentionally train yourself to hear that voice of intuition every day by taking note\\nof what it tells you. Besides capturing what personally resonates with you, there are a couple other\\nkinds of details that are generally useful to save in your notes.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"72fa30b7-e892-44c9-8d00-dadf17d8e335":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"72fa30b7-e892-44c9-8d00-dadf17d8e335\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"ba1eedc3-754f-4286-a428-303fb98cbef0\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"a8f42a59-ee2f-4386-9a72-f96e19318b09\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"It’s a good idea to\\ncapture key information about the source of a note, such as the original web page\\naddress,  the  title  of  the  piece,  the  author  or  publisher,  and  the  date  it  was\\npublished.

Beyond Your Notetaking App: Choosing Capture Tools\\nNow that you know what kinds of material to save in your Second Brain, it’s time\\nto get into the nitty-gritty: How does capturing work exactly? Let’s say while reading that in-depth marketing article, you decide a specific\\npiece  of  advice  is  highly  relevant  to  your  own  plans. Most  notetaking  apps\\n(introduced  in  Chapter  2  and  covered  in  detail  in  the  Second  Brain  Resource\\nGuide at Buildingasecondbrain. com/resources) have built-in features that allow\\nyou to capture excerpts from outside sources, and you can always simply cut and\\npaste  text  directly  into  a  new  note. There  is  also  an  array  of  more  specialized\\n“capture tools” that are designed to make capturing content in digital form easy\\nand even fun. The most common options include:\\nEbook  apps,  which  often  allow  you  to  export  your  highlights  or\\nannotations all at once. Read later apps that allow you to bookmark content you find online for\\nlater reading (or in the case of podcasts or videos, listening or watching). Basic  notes  apps  that  often  come  preinstalled  on  mobile  devices  and  are\\ndesigned for easily capturing short snippets of text. Social media apps, which usually allow you to “favorite” content and export\\nit to a notes app. Web clippers, which allow you to save parts of web pages (often included as\\na built-in feature of notes apps). Audio/voice  transcription  apps  that  create  text  transcripts  from  spoken\\nwords. Other  third-party  services,  integrations,  and  plug-ins  that  automate  the\\nprocess of exporting content from one app to another. Some of these tools are free, and others charge a small fee. Some are completely\\nautomatic, working silently in the background (for example, to automatically sync\\nyour  ebook  highlights  with  a  notes  app),  while  others  require  a  bit  of  manual\\neffort (such as taking photos of paper notebooks to save them digitally). IV\\n But in\\nany case, the act of capture takes only moments—to hit share, export, or save—\\n\\nand voilà, you’ve preserved the best parts of whatever you’re consuming in your\\nSecond Brain. Make no mistake: you will continue to use many kinds of software to manage\\ninformation—such  as  computer  folders,  cloud  storage  drives,  and  various\\nplatforms  for  sharing  and  collaborating  on  documents. Think  of  your  capture\\ntools as your extended nervous system, reaching out into the world to allow you\\nto sense your surroundings. No matter how many different kinds of software you\\nuse, don’t leave all the knowledge they contain scattered across dozens of places\\nyou’ll never think to look. Make sure your best findings get routed back to your\\nnotes app where you can put them all together and act on them. Here are some of the most popular ways of using capture tools to save content\\nyou come across:\\nCapturing passages from ebooks: Most ebook apps make it very easy to\\nhighlight  passages  as  you  read. On  Amazon  Kindle,  you  can  simply  drag\\nyour finger across a sentence or paragraph you like to add a highlight. Then\\nuse the share menu to export all your highlights from the entire book all at\\nonce  straight  to  your  digital  notes.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a8f42a59-ee2f-4386-9a72-f96e19318b09":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a8f42a59-ee2f-4386-9a72-f96e19318b09\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"72fa30b7-e892-44c9-8d00-dadf17d8e335\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"f0793149-d181-4070-af46-399706c98869\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"You  can  also  add  comments  right\\nalongside  the  text  as  you  read,  which  will  help  you  remember  what  you\\nfound interesting about a passage. Capturing  excerpts  from  online  articles  or  web  pages:  When  you\\ncome across an online article or blog post you want to read, save it to a “read\\nlater” app, which is like a digital magazine rack of everything you want to\\nread (or watch or listen to) at some point. Whenever you have some free\\ntime (such as on breaks or in the evening after work), scroll through the\\narticles you’ve saved and pick one to read. You can make highlights, just as\\nwith ebooks, and they can also be automatically exported to your notes app\\nusing a third-party platform. Capturing quotes from podcasts: Many podcast player apps allow you to\\nbookmark or “clip” segments of episodes as you’re listening to them. Some\\nof  them  will  even  transcribe  the  audio  into  text,  so  you  can  export  and\\nsearch it within your notes. Capturing voice memos: Use a voice memo app that allows you to press a\\nbutton,  speak  directly  into  your  smartphone,  and  have  every  word\\ntranscribed into text and exported to your notes. Capturing parts of YouTube videos: This is a little-known feature, but\\nalmost every YouTube video is accompanied by an automatically generated\\ntranscript. Just click the “Open transcript” button and a window will open. From there, you can copy and paste excerpts to your notes. Capturing excerpts from emails:  Most  popular  notes  apps  include  a\\nfeature that allows you to forward any email to a special address, and the\\nfull text of that email (including any attachments) will be added to your\\nnotes. Capturing content from other apps: You might edit photos in a photos\\napp, or make sketches in a drawing app, or like posts in a social media app. As long as that app has a “share” button or allows for copy-and-paste, you\\ncan save whatever you’ve created directly to your notes for safekeeping. The Surprising Benefits of Externalizing Our Thoughts\\nOften ideas occur to us at the most random times—during our commute, while\\nwatching TV, when we’re playing with our kids, or in the shower. Your Second Brain gives you a place to corral the jumble of thoughts tumbling\\nthrough your head and park them in a waiting area for safekeeping. Not only does\\nthis  allow  you  to  preserve  them  for  the  long  term;  there  are  multiple  other\\nprofound benefits that come from the simple act of writing something down. First, you are much more likely to remember information you’ve written down\\nin your own words. Known as the “Generation Effect,”\\n10\\n researchers have found\\nthat  when  people  actively  generate  a  series  of  words,  such  as  by  speaking  or\\nwriting, more parts of their brain are activated when compared to simply reading\\nthe same words. Writing things down is a way of “rehearsing” those ideas, like\\npracticing a dance routine or shooting hoops, which makes them far more likely\\nto stick. Enhancing  our  memory  is  just  the  beginning. When  you  express  an  idea  in\\nwriting, it’s not just a matter of transferring the exact contents of your mind into\\npaper or digital form. Writing creates new knowledge that wasn’t there before. Each word you write triggers mental cascades and internal associations, leading to\\nfurther ideas, all of which can come tumbling out onto the page or screen. V\\nThinking doesn’t just produce writing; writing also enriches thinking. There is even significant evidence that expressing our thoughts in writing can\\nlead to benefits for our health and well-being. 11\\n One of the most cited psychology\\npapers of the 1990s found that “translating emotional events into words leads to\\nprofound social, psychological, and neural changes.” In a wide range of controlled studies, writing about one’s inner experiences led\\nto a drop in visits to the doctor, improved immune systems, and reductions in\\ndistress.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f0793149-d181-4070-af46-399706c98869":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f0793149-d181-4070-af46-399706c98869\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a8f42a59-ee2f-4386-9a72-f96e19318b09\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"0c1c2d46-88f4-4084-9acb-c44533b04a0e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Students  who  wrote  about  emotional  topics  showed  improvements  in\\ntheir grades, professionals who had been laid off found new jobs more quickly,\\nand staff members were absent from work at lower rates. The most amazing thing\\nabout these findings is that they didn’t rely on input from others. No one had to\\nread or respond to what these people wrote down—the benefits came just from\\nthe act of writing. Perhaps the most immediate benefit of capturing content outside our heads is\\nthat we escape what I call the “reactivity loop”—the hamster wheel of urgency,\\noutrage,  and  sensationalism  that  characterizes  so  much  of  the  Internet. The\\nmoment you first encounter an idea is the worst time to decide what it means. You need to set it aside and gain some objectivity. With a Second Brain as a shield against the media storm, we no longer have to\\nreact to each idea immediately, or risk losing it forever. We can set things aside and\\nget to them later when we are calmer and more grounded. We can take our time\\nslowly absorbing new information and integrating it into our thinking, free of the\\npressing demands of the moment. I’m always amazed that when I revisit the items\\nI’ve previously saved to read later, many of them that seemed so important at the\\ntime are clearly trivial and unneeded. Notetaking  is  the  easiest  and  simplest  way  of  externalizing  our  thinking. It\\nrequires no special skill, is private by default, and can be performed anytime and\\nanywhere. Once our thoughts are outside our head, we can examine them, play\\n\\nwith them, and make them better. It’s like a shortcut to realizing the full potential\\nof the thoughts flowing through our minds. Your Turn: What Would This Look Like If It Was Easy? I’ve introduced a lot of ideas in this chapter, and I know it’s a lot to absorb. There\\nare so many ways to capture knowledge, but when you’re just getting started all\\nthose options can just feel overwhelming. I want to give you an open question that will help guide you as you embark on\\nthis journey: What would capturing ideas look like if it was easy? Think about what you would want to capture more of (or less of). How would\\nthat feel? What kinds of content are already familiar enough that it would be easy\\nto begin saving them now? What would capturing look like today or this week? On  average  I  capture  just  two  notes  per  day—what  are  two  ideas,  insights,\\nobservations,  perspectives,  or  lessons  you’ve  encountered  today  that  you  could\\nwrite down right now? It’s important to keep capturing relatively effortless because it is only the first\\nstep. You need to do it enough that it becomes second nature, while conserving\\nyour time and energy for the later steps when the value of the ideas you’ve found\\ncan be fully unleashed. Capture  isn’t  about  doing  more. It’s  about  taking  notes  on  the  experiences\\nyou’re  already  having. It’s  about  squeezing  more  juice  out  of  the  fruit  of  life,\\nsavoring every moment to the fullest by paying closer attention to the details. Don’t worry about whether you’re capturing “correctly.” There’s no right way\\nto do this, and therefore, no wrong way. The only way to know whether you’re\\ngetting the good stuff is to try putting it to use in real life. We’ll get to that soon,\\nbut in the meantime, try out a couple of digital notes apps and capture tools to see\\nwhich ones fit your style. Don’t forget the resource guide I’ve put together to help\\nyou make your choice. If at any point you feel stuck or overwhelmed, step back and remember that\\nnothing is permanent in the digital world. Digital content is endlessly malleable,\\nso you don’t have to commit to any decision forever. While every step of CODE\\n\\ncomplements the others, you can also use them one at a time. Start with the parts\\nthat resonate with you and expand from there as your confidence grows. In the next chapter, I’ll tell you what to do with the knowledge assets you’ve\\ngathered in your Second Brain.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0c1c2d46-88f4-4084-9acb-c44533b04a0e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0c1c2d46-88f4-4084-9acb-c44533b04a0e\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"f0793149-d181-4070-af46-399706c98869\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"4deb03b1-9a4f-414f-8a93-76480651f81f\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"I.

Chapter 5\\nOrganize—Save for Actionability\\nBe regular and orderly in your life so that you may be violent and\\noriginal in your work. —Gustave Flaubert, French novelist\\nTwyla Tharp is one of the most celebrated, inventive dance choreographers in\\nmodern times. Her body of work is made up of more than 160 pieces, including\\n129  dances,  twelve  television  specials,  six  major  Hollywood  movies,  four  full-\\nlength ballets, four Broadway shows, and two figure-skating routines. Dance  might  seem  like  the  creative  medium  that  could  least  benefit  from\\n“organizing.” It  is  performed  live  each  time,  using  primarily  the  dancers’  own\\nbodies, and often seems improvisational and spontaneous. Yet in her book The\\nCreative  Habit,\\n1\\n  Tharp  revealed  that  a  simple  organizing  technique  lies  at  the\\nheart of a creative process that has propelled her through an incredibly prolific six-\\ndecade career. Tharp calls her approach “the box.” Every time she begins a new project, she\\ntakes out a foldable file box and labels it with the name of the project, usually the\\nname  of  the  dance  she  is  choreographing. This initial  act  gives  her  a  sense  of\\npurpose  as  she  begins:  “The  box  makes  me  feel  organized,  that  I  have  my  act\\ntogether  even  when  I  don’t  know  where  I’m  going  yet. It  also  represents  a\\ncommitment. The simple act of writing a project name on the box means I’ve\\nstarted work.” Into  the  box  she  puts  anything  and  everything  related  to  the  project,  like  a\\nswirling cauldron of creative energy.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4deb03b1-9a4f-414f-8a93-76480651f81f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4deb03b1-9a4f-414f-8a93-76480651f81f\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"0c1c2d46-88f4-4084-9acb-c44533b04a0e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"60cfa6a6-6e69-49d5-9a77-10cfa78244e0\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Any time she finds a new piece of material—\\nsuch as “notebooks, news clippings, CDs, videotapes of me working alone in my\\n\\nstudio, videos of the dancers rehearsing, books and photographs and pieces of art\\nthat may have inspired me”—she always knows where to put it. It all goes into the\\nbox. Which  means  that  any  time  she  works  on  that  project,  she  knows  exactly\\nwhere to look—in the box. In her book, Tharp tells the story of a specific project where the box proved\\ninvaluable: a collaboration with the pop rock icon Billy Joel to turn a collection of\\nhis  songs  into  a  full-length  dance  performance. It  was  a  bold  idea,  somewhere\\nbetween a concert and a musical, but quite distinct from either one. It wasn’t clear\\nhow the characters in different songs, who weren’t written as part of the same\\nstory, could be combined into the same narrative. Even a project as open-ended as this one started the same way as all the others,\\nwith her goals: “I believe in starting each project with a stated goal. Sometimes the\\ngoal is nothing more than a personal mantra such as ‘keep it simple’ or ‘something\\nperfect’ or ‘economy’ to remind me of what I was thinking at the beginning if and\\nwhen I lose my way. I write it down on a slip of paper and it’s the first thing that\\ngoes into the box.” For  the  collaboration  with  Joel,  Tharp  had  two  goals:  The  first  was  to\\nunderstand  and  master  the  role  of  narrative  in  dance,  a  long-standing  creative\\nchallenge  that  had  captured  her  curiosity. The  second  goal  was  much  more\\npractical, but no less motivating: to pay her dancers well. She said, “So I wrote my\\ngoals for the project, ‘tell a story’ and ‘make dance pay,’ on two blue index cards\\nand watched them float to the bottom of the Joel box... they sit there as I write\\nthis, covered by months of research, like an anchor keeping me connected to my\\noriginal impulse.” After  that,  every  bit  of  research  and  every  idea  potentially  relevant  to  the\\nproject  went  into  Tharp’s  box. Recordings  of  Billy  Joel’s  music  videos,  live\\nperformances, lectures, photographs, news clippings, song lists, and notes about\\nthose  songs. She  gathered  news  footage  and  movies  about  the  Vietnam  War,\\nimportant  books  from  the  era,  and  even  material  from  other  boxes,  including\\nresearch from an abandoned project that never made it onto the stage. The artifacts that Tharp collected weren’t just for her own use. They became\\nsparks of inspiration for her team: a pair of earrings and a macramé vest shared\\nwith  the  costume  designer;  books  about  psychedelic  light  events  to  inspire  the\\n\\nlighting designer; photographs from other shows and Joel’s childhood home in\\nLong Island to discuss with the production designer. All  this  creative  raw  material  eventually  filled  twelve  boxes,  but  all  the\\ncollecting and gathering from the outside world doesn’t mean that Tharp didn’t\\nadd her own creativity. For example, she found an elaborate set of notes from an\\nearly song of Joel’s called “She’s Got a Way,” which was full of innocence and\\nsweetness. She decided to change its meaning: “In my notes you can see the song\\nmorphing into something harsher, eventually becoming two simultaneous sleazy\\nbar scenes, one in Vietnam, the other back home. I felt obliged to run this by Billy,\\nwarning him, ‘This is going to destroy the song.’ He wasn’t worried. ‘Go for it,’ he\\nsaid.” Twyla Tharp’s box gave her several powerful advantages as she set out on her\\ncreative journey. The box gave her the security to venture out and take risks: “a box is like soil to\\nme.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"60cfa6a6-6e69-49d5-9a77-10cfa78244e0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"60cfa6a6-6e69-49d5-9a77-10cfa78244e0\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"4deb03b1-9a4f-414f-8a93-76480651f81f\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"54046bad-7d42-4bbd-b22c-f3fde6ebd418\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"It’s basic, earthy, elemental.

I  feel  this  even  when  I’ve  back-\\nburnered a project: I may have put the box away on a shelf, but I know it’s there.

A  lot  of  people  don’t\\nappreciate this. When they’re done with a project, they’re relieved. They’re ready\\nfor a break and then they want to move forward to the next idea. The box gives\\nyou the opportunity to reflect on your performance. Dig down through the boxes\\narchaeologically  and  you’ll  see  a  project’s  beginnings. This  can  be  instructive. How did you do? Did you get to your goal? Did you improve on it? Did it change\\nalong the way? Could you have done it all more efficiently?” Twyla Tharp’s box reveals the true value of a simple container: it is easy to use,\\neasy to understand, easy to create, and easy to maintain. It can be moved from\\nplace  to  place  without  losing  its  contents. A  container  requires  no  effort  to\\n\\nidentify, to share with others, and to put in storage when it’s no longer needed. We  don’t  need  complex,  sophisticated  systems  to  be  able  to  produce  complex,\\nsophisticated works. The Cathedral Effect: Designing a Space for Your Ideas\\nConsider  how  much  time  we  spend  designing  and  arranging  our  physical\\nenvironment. We buy nice furniture, deliberate for weeks over the color of our walls, and\\nfiddle  with  the  placement  of  plants  and  books. We  know  that  the  details  of\\nlighting, temperature, and the layout of a space dramatically affect how we feel\\nand think. There’s  a  name  for  this  phenomenon:  the  Cathedral  Effect. 2\\n  Studies  have\\nshown that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking. When  we  are  in  a  space  with  high  ceilings,  for  example—think  of  the  lofty\\narchitecture  of  classic  churches  invoking  the  grandeur  of  heaven—we  tend  to\\nthink in more abstract ways. When we’re in a room with low ceilings, such as a\\nsmall workshop, we’re more likely to think concretely. No one questions the importance of having physical spaces that make us feel\\ncalm and centered, but when it comes to your digital workspace, it’s likely you’ve\\nspent  little  time,  if  any,  arranging  that  space  to  enhance  your  productivity  or\\ncreativity. As knowledge workers we spend many hours every day within digital\\nenvironments—our  computers,  smartphones,  and  the  web. Unless  you  take\\ncontrol of those virtual spaces and shape them to support the kinds of thinking\\nyou want to do, every minute spent there will feel taxing and distracting.

It’s\\ntime for us to put more intention into the digital environments where we now\\nspend so many of our waking hours. Once you’ve created this environment, you’ll know where to go when it’s time\\nto  execute  or  create.

Your\\nSecond Brain is like a mind cathedral that you can step into any time you want to\\nshut out the world and imagine a world of your own. The next step in building your Second Brain is to take the morsels of insight\\nyou’ve begun to capture and organize them in a space where you can do your best\\nthinking. Organizing for Action: Where 99 Percent of Notetakers Get\\nStuck (And How to Solve It)\\nAs you begin to capture your ideas in a consistent way, you’re likely to experience\\na new sense of excitement about the information flowing all around you. You’ll start to pay closer attention to the books you read, the conversations you\\nhave,  and  the  interviews  you  listen  to,  knowing  that  any  interesting  idea  you\\nencounter  can  be  reliably  saved  and  utilized. You  no  longer  have  to  hope  that\\nyou’ll remember your best ideas—you can ensure that you will. Soon, however, you’ll run head on into a new problem: what to do with all this\\nvaluable material you’ve gathered. The more diligently you collect it, the bigger\\nthis problem will be! Capturing notes without an effective way to organize and\\nretrieve them only leads to more overwhelm. I spent years trying different ways of solving the problem of how to organize\\nmy digital life. I tried techniques borrowed from organizing physical spaces, every\\nkind of specially formatted notebook, and even the Dewey decimal system used in\\nlibraries. I  tried  organizing  my  files  by  date,  by  subject,  by  kind,  and  countless\\nother elaborate schemes, but every method I tried soon failed. The problem was that none of these systems was integrated into my daily life. They always required me to follow a series of elaborate rules that took time away\\nfrom my other priorities, which meant they would quickly become outdated and\\nobsolete. Every time I fell off the organizing wagon, I reverted to dropping all my\\nnotes and files into a folder for whichever project I was currently focused on. This\\n\\nensured that at least I had exactly what I needed for my current work immediately\\non hand—no tagging, filing, or keywords needed. Then one day I had a realization: Why didn’t I just organize my files that way\\nall  the  time? If  organizing  by  project  was  the  most  natural  way  to  manage\\ninformation with minimal effort, why not make it the default? That  is  what  I  did,  and  to  my  surprise,  it  worked. Over  time,  I  refined,\\nsimplified, and tested this action-based approach with thousands of students and\\nfollowers. I eventually named this organizing system PARA,\\nI\\n which stands for the\\nfour main categories of information in our lives: Projects, Areas, Resources, and\\nArchives. These  four  categories  are  universal,  encompassing any  kind  of\\ninformation, from any source, in any format, for any purpose. II\\nPARA can handle it all, regardless of your profession or field, for one reason: it\\norganizes information based on how actionable it is, not what kind of information\\nit  is. The  project  becomes  the  main  unit  of  organization  for  your  digital  files. Instead of having to sort your notes according to a complex hierarchy of topics\\nand subtopics, you have to answer only one simple question: “In which project\\nwill this be most useful?” It assumes only that you are currently working on a\\ncertain set of projects, and that your information should be organized to support\\nthem.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"8d777205-fdee-4480-a5f7-925d8ee7308e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"8d777205-fdee-4480-a5f7-925d8ee7308e\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"54046bad-7d42-4bbd-b22c-f3fde6ebd418\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"676fafe4-8f70-4dfb-8cd0-aa9311413a7f\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"For  example,  say  you  come  across  a  useful  article  on  how  to  become  more\\nresilient and capture it in your notes.

Projects:  Short-term  efforts  in  your  work  or  life  that  you’re  working  on\\nnow. 2. Areas: Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time. 3. Resources: Topics or interests that may be useful in the future. 4. Archives: Inactive items from the other three categories. Projects: What I’m Working on Right Now\\n\\nProjects  include  the  short-term  outcomes  you’re  actively  working  toward  right\\nnow. Projects  have  a  couple  of  features  that  make  them  an  ideal  way  to  organize\\nmodern work. First, they have a beginning and an end; they take place during a\\nspecific period of time and then they finish. Second, they have a specific, clear\\noutcome that needs to happen in order for them to be checked off as complete,\\nsuch as “finalize,” “green-light,” “launch,” or “publish.” A  project-centric  way  of  working  comes  naturally  in  the  creative  and\\nperforming  arts. Artists  have  paintings,  dancers  have  dances,  musicians  have\\nsongs,  and  poets  have  poems. These  are  clearly  identifiable,  discrete  chunks  of\\nwork. This  project-centric  approach  is  increasingly  finding  its  way  into  all\\nknowledge work, a trend named the “Hollywood model” after the way films are\\nmade. As an article in the New York Times\\n3\\n explains, “A project is identified; a team is\\nassembled; it works together for precisely as long as is needed to complete the task;\\nthen the team disbands... The Hollywood model is now used to build bridges,\\ndesign apps or start restaurants.” It is becoming more and more common for all of\\nus to work across teams, departments, and even different companies to execute\\ncollaborative projects, and then once it’s over, each go our own way. Examples of projects could include:\\nProjects  at  work:  Complete  web-page  design;  Create  slide  deck  for\\nconference; Develop project schedule; Plan recruitment drive. Personal projects: Finish Spanish language course; Plan vacation; Buy new\\nliving room furniture; Find local volunteer opportunity. Side  projects:  Publish  blog  post;  Launch  crowdfunding  campaign;\\nResearch best podcast microphone; Complete online course. If you are not already framing your work in terms of specific, concrete projects,\\nmaking  this  shift  will  give  you  a  powerful  jump  start  to  your productivity. Whether you’re self-employed, at a large corporation, or somewhere in between,\\nwe are all moving toward a world of project-based work. Knowing which projects\\n\\nyou’re currently committed to is crucial to being able to prioritize your week, plan\\nyour progress, and say no to things that aren’t important. Areas: What I’m Committed to Over Time\\nAs important as projects are, not everything is a project. For example, the area of our lives called “Finances” doesn’t have a definite end\\ndate. It’s something that we will have to think about and manage, in one way or\\nanother, for as long as we live.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ebc8dd8c-6682-4cea-ab7b-3e7c25262b3b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ebc8dd8c-6682-4cea-ab7b-3e7c25262b3b\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"676fafe4-8f70-4dfb-8cd0-aa9311413a7f\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ce081156-507d-4b06-9993-1529c98f33e7\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"It doesn’t have a final objective. Even if you win the\\nlottery, you’ll still have finances to manage (and it will probably require a lot more\\nattention!) . In our work lives, we have various ongoing areas we’re responsible for, such as\\n“product development,” “quality control,” or “human resources.” These are the\\njob responsibilities that we were hired to take on. Sometimes there are others that\\nwe officially or unofficially have taken ownership of over time. Each of these is an example of an area of responsibility, and together they make\\nup  the  second  main  category  of  PARA. All  these  areas,  both  personal  and\\nprofessional, require certain information to be handled effectively, but they’re not\\nthe same as projects. In  the  case  of  finances,  you  may  have  notes  from  calls  with  your  financial\\nadvisor, receipts or invoices for business purchases, and your monthly household\\nbudget,  among  many  other  kinds  of  information. You  might  also  have  more\\nspeculative information to manage, like financial projections, research on personal\\nfinance software, and data on investment trends you’re keeping an eye on. For a work-related area like “product development,” you might need to save\\nproduct specifications, R&D findings, notes from customer research interviews,\\n\\nand customer satisfaction ratings. You could also have photos of products you\\nadmire to use as design inspiration, manufacturing blueprints, or color palettes. It\\nall depends on your relationship to that area of your life, and how you want to\\nmanage it or move it forward. Examples of areas from your personal life could include:\\nActivities  or  places  you  are  responsible  for:  Home/apartment;\\nCooking; Travel; Car. People  you  are  responsible  for  or  accountable  to:  Friends;  Kids;\\nSpouse; Pets. Standards of performance you are responsible for:  Health;  Personal\\ngrowth; Friendships; Finances. In your job or business:\\nDepartments  or  functions  you  are  responsible  for:  Account\\nmanagement; Marketing; Operations; Product development. People or teams you are responsible for or accountable to:  Direct\\nreports; Manager; Board of directors; Suppliers. Standards  of  performance  you  are  responsible  for:  Professional\\ndevelopment;  Sales  and  marketing;  Relationships  and  networking;\\nRecruiting and hiring. Even though areas have no final outcome, it is still important to manage them. In  fact,  if  you  look  at  the  list  above,  these  areas  are  critical  to  your  health,\\nhappiness, security, and life satisfaction. While there is no goal to reach, there is a standard that you want to uphold in\\neach of these areas. For finances, that standard may be that you always pay your\\nbills on time and provide for your family’s basic needs. For health, it may be that\\nyou exercise a certain number of times per week and keep your cholesterol below a\\ncertain number. For family, it may be that you spend quality time with them every\\nevening and on the weekend. Only  you  can  decide  what  those  standards  are. For  our  purposes,  it  helps\\ntremendously to have a place dedicated to each of them. That way you always\\nhave  somewhere  to  put  any  thought,  reflection,  idea,  or  useful  tidbit  of\\ninformation relevant to each important aspect of your life. Resources: Things I Want to Reference in the Future\\nThe  third  category  of  information  that  we  want  to  keep  is  resources. This  is\\nbasically a catchall for anything that doesn’t belong to a project or an area and\\ncould include any topic you’re interested in gathering information about. For example:\\nWhat topics are you interested in? Architecture; Interior design; English\\nliterature; Beer brewing. What  subjects  are  you  researching?

These folders are like the class notebooks\\nyou  probably  kept  in  school:  one  for  biology,  another  for  history,  another  for\\nmath. Any note or file that isn’t relevant or actionable for a current project or area\\ncan be placed into resources for future reference. Archives: Things I’ve Completed or Put on Hold\\n\\nFinally,  we  have  our  archives. This  includes  any  item  from  the  previous  three\\ncategories that is no longer active. For example:\\nProjects that are completed or canceled\\nAreas  of  responsibility  that  you  are  no  longer  committed  to  maintaining\\n(such as when a relationship ends or after moving out of your apartment)\\nResources  that  are  no  longer  relevant  (hobbies  you  lose  interest  in  or\\nsubjects you no longer care about)\\nThe archives are an important part of PARA because they allow you to place a\\nfolder  in  “cold  storage”  so  that  it  doesn’t  clutter  your  workspace,  while\\nsafekeeping it forever just in case you need it. Unlike with your house or garage,\\nthere is no penalty for keeping digital stuff forever, as long as it doesn’t distract\\nfrom your day-to-day focus. If you need access to that information in the future—\\nfor example, if you take on a project similar to one you previously completed—\\nyou can call it up within seconds. What PARA Looks Like: A Behind-the-Scenes Snapshot\\nPARA is a universal system of organization designed to work across your digital\\nworld. It doesn’t work in only one place, requiring you to use completely different\\norganizing schemes in each of the dozens of places you keep things. It can and\\nshould be used everywhere, such as the documents folder on your computer, your\\ncloud storage drives, and of course, your digital notes app. Let me show you what it looks like. Here’s an example of what the folders in my notes app look like with PARA:\\n\\nInside each of these top-level folders, I have individual folders for the specific\\nprojects, areas, resources, and archives that make up my life. For example, here are\\nthe folders for each one of my active projects:\\nInside these folders live the actual notes that contain my ideas. The number of\\nactive projects usually ranges from five to fifteen for the average person. Notice\\nthat the number of notes inside each one (indicated by the number in parentheses\\nafter  the  title)  varies  greatly,  from  just  two  to  over  two  hundred  for  the  book\\nyou’re reading right now. Here are the notes found within a typical project folder for a midsize project, a\\nremodel  of  our  garage  into  a  home  studio  (which  we’ll  dive  deeper  into  in\\nsubsequent chapters):\\nThe left half of the window displays a list of the twenty-seven notes within this\\nfolder. Clicking a note, such as the one shown above containing a collection of\\n\\nphotos we used to inspire our own remodel, reveals its contents in the right half of\\nthe window. That’s it—just three levels of hierarchy to encompass the thousands of notes\\nI’ve accumulated over the years: the top-level PARA categories, the project folder,\\nand the notes themselves. Here is what some of my areas look like:\\nEach of these folders contains the notes relevant to each of those ongoing areas\\nof my life. Areas related to my business begin with “FL” for Forte Labs, so they\\nappear together in alphabetical order.

I want them completely out of sight and off my mind, but in case I\\never need to access research, learnings, or material from the past, it will always be\\npreserved. PARA can be used across all the different places where you store information,\\nmeaning you can use the same categories and the same rules of thumb no matter\\nwhere  you  keep  content. For  example,  here  is  the  documents  folder  on  my\\ncomputer:\\n\\nAnd the folders for each one of my active projects:\\nInside these folders live the files that I use to execute each project. Here is the\\nproject folder dedicated to the book you’re reading right now:\\nWhere Do I Put This? —How to Decide Where to Save\\nIndividual Notes\\n\\nSetting up folders is relatively easy. The harder question that strikes fear into the\\nheart of every organizer is “Where do I put this?” Apps have made it extremely easy to capture content—it’s just a click or a tap\\naway. However, we are given no guidance for what to do next. Where does a note\\ngo once it’s been created? What is the correct location for an incoming file? The\\nmore material piles up, the more urgent and stressful this problem becomes. The temptation when initially capturing notes is to also try to decide where\\nthey should go and what they mean. Here’s the problem: the moment you first\\ncapture an idea is the worst time to try to decide what it relates to. First, because\\nyou’ve  just  encountered  it  and  haven’t  had  any  time  to  ponder  its  ultimate\\npurpose, but more importantly, because forcing yourself to make decisions every\\ntime you capture something adds a lot of friction to the process. This makes the\\nexperience mentally taxing and thus less likely to happen in the first place. This is why it’s so important to separate capture and organize into two distinct\\nsteps:  “keeping  what  resonates”  in  the  moment  is  a  separate  decision  from\\ndeciding to save something for the long term. Most notes apps have an “inbox” or\\n“daily notes” section where new notes you’ve captured are saved until you can\\nrevisit them and decide where they belong. Think of it as a waiting area where new\\nideas live until you are ready to digest them into your Second Brain. Separating\\nthe  capturing  and  organizing  of  ideas  helps  you  stay  present,  notice  what\\nresonates, and leave the decision of what to do with them to a separate time (such\\nas a “weekly review,” which I will cover in Chapter 9). Once you’ve captured a batch of notes and it’s time to organize them, PARA\\ncomes into play. The four main categories are ordered by actionability to make the\\ndecision of where to put notes as easy as possible:\\nProjects are most actionable because you’re working on them right now and\\nwith a concrete deadline in mind. Areas have a longer time horizon and are less immediately actionable. Resources may become actionable depending on the situation. Archives remain inactive unless they are needed. This order gives us a convenient checklist for deciding where to put a note,\\nstarting at the top of the list and moving down:\\n1. In which project will this be most useful? 2. If none: In which area will this be most useful? 3. If none: Which resource does this belong to? 4. If none: Place in archives. In other words, you are always trying to place a note or file not only where it\\nwill be useful, but where it will be useful the soonest. By placing a note in a project\\nfolder, you ensure you’ll see it next time you work on that project. By placing it in\\nan area folder, you’ll come across it next time you’re thinking about that area of\\nyour work or life.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"54150131-cf0d-4c43-bdd2-ebc1eef86c42":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"54150131-cf0d-4c43-bdd2-ebc1eef86c42\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"4c0e8cf4-459a-4a09-96af-af969143c85a\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"803f4930-3f70-4cb0-9114-732a429542b4\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"By placing it in a resource folder, you’ll notice it only if and\\nwhen  you  decide  to  dive  into  that  topic  and  do  some  reading  or  research.

Personal projects and long-term goals feel especially flexible, like you can\\nalways get around to them later. Notes, bookmarks, highlights, and research that\\nwe  worked  hard  to  find  sink  deeper  and  deeper  into  our  file  systems,  until\\neventually we forget they even exist. Organizing  by  actionability  counteracts  our  tendency  to  constantly\\nprocrastinate and postpone our aspirations to some far-off future. PARA pulls\\nthese distant dreams into the here and now, by helping us see that we already have\\na  lot  of  the  information  we  need  to  get  started. The  goal  of  organizing  our\\nknowledge is to move our goals forward, not get a PhD in notetaking. Knowledge\\nis best applied through execution, which means whatever doesn’t help you make\\nprogress on your projects is probably detracting from them. Organizing Information Like a Kitchen—What Am I Making? There is a parallel between PARA and how kitchens are organized. Everything in a kitchen is designed and organized to support an outcome—\\npreparing a meal as efficiently as possible. The archives are like the freezer—items\\nare  in  cold  storage  until  they  are  needed, which  could  be  far  into  the  future. Resources are like the pantry—available for use in any meal you make, but neatly\\ntucked away out of sight in the meantime. Areas are like the fridge—items that\\nyou plan on using relatively soon, and that you want to check on more frequently. Projects  are  like  the  pots  and  pans  cooking  on  the  stove—the  items  you  are\\nactively preparing right now. Each kind of food is organized according to how\\naccessible it needs to be for you to make the meals you want to eat. Imagine how absurd it would be to organize a kitchen instead by kind of food:\\nfresh fruit, dried fruit, fruit juice, and frozen fruit would all be stored in the same\\nplace, just because they all happen to be made of fruit. Yet this is exactly the way\\nmost people organize their files and notes—keeping all their book notes together\\njust because they happen to come from books, or all their saved quotes together\\njust because they happen to be quotes. Instead of organizing ideas according to where  they  come  from, I recommend\\norganizing  them  according  to where  they  are  going—specifically,  the  outcomes\\nthat they can help you realize. The true test of whether a piece of knowledge is\\nvaluable is not whether it is perfectly organized and neatly labeled, but whether it\\ncan have an impact on someone or something that matters to you. PARA isn’t a filing system; it’s a production system. It’s no use trying to find\\nthe “perfect place” where a note or file belongs. There isn’t one. The whole system\\nis constantly shifting and changing in sync with your constantly changing life. This is a challenging idea for a lot of people to wrap their head around. We are\\nused to organizational systems that are static and fixed. We expect to find a strict\\nset of rules that tells us exactly where each item goes, like the precise call numbers\\nfor books in a library. When it comes to our personal knowledge, there is no such assigned spot. We\\nare  organizing  for  actionability,  and  “what’s  actionable”  is always  changing. Sometimes we can receive one text message or email and the entire landscape of\\nour day changes. Because our priorities can change at a moment’s notice, we have\\nto  minimize  the  time  we  spend  filing,  labeling,  tagging,  and  maintaining  our\\ndigital notes. We can’t run the risk of all that effort going to waste. Any piece of information (whether a text document, an image, a note, or an\\nentire folder) can and should flow between categories.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"803f4930-3f70-4cb0-9114-732a429542b4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"803f4930-3f70-4cb0-9114-732a429542b4\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"54150131-cf0d-4c43-bdd2-ebc1eef86c42\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"90f77eda-9e8b-4d3a-9b89-1b6cc69d853e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"You might save a note on\\ncoaching techniques to a project folder called “Coaching class,” for a class you’re\\ntaking.

It  is  about  identifying  the\\nstructure of your work and life—what you are committed to, what you want to\\nchange, and where you want to go. I had to learn this lesson the hard way. Back in college, I worked part-time at an\\nApple Store in San Diego while I finished my studies. At the time it was one of the\\nfive busiest Apple Stores in the world, with thousands of people walking through\\nour doors every day. It was there that I got my first taste of teaching people how to\\nuse computers more effectively. I taught morning classes to small groups of people who had just bought their\\nfirst Mac, and also did one-on-one consultation sessions. This was the golden age\\nof  Apple’s  iLife  suite  of  creative  software:  every  single  Mac  computer  came\\npreinstalled  with  user-friendly  apps  for  creating  websites,  recording  music,\\n\\nprinting  photo  books,  and  making  videos. It  was  like  having  a  complete\\nmultimedia studio at your fingertips at no additional cost. I would sit down with customers and answer any questions they had about the\\nnew computer they had just bought. In most cases they had just migrated all their\\nfiles  over  from  Windows,  and  years  of  accumulated  documents  lay  scattered\\nacross their desktop and documents folders. At first I tried guiding them through organizing each document one at a time. It quickly became clear that this didn’t work at all. The one-on-one sessions were\\nonly one hour, not nearly enough time to make even a dent in the hundreds or\\neven thousands of files they had. It wasn’t time well spent anyway, because these\\nwere often old documents that weren’t relevant to their current goals or interests. I knew I needed a new approach. I started asking questions and listening, and\\neventually realized that these people didn’t need or want an organized computer. They  had  spent  all  this  money  and  time  moving  to  a  Mac  because  there  was\\nsomething they wanted to create or achieve. They wanted to make a video for their parents’ anniversary party, a website for\\ntheir cupcake shop, or a record showcasing their band’s songs. They wanted to\\nresearch  their  family  genealogy,  graduate  from  college,  or  land  a  better  job. Everything else was just an obstacle to get past on the way to their goal. I decided to take a different approach: I took all the files they’d migrated over\\nand moved them all to a new folder titled “Archive” plus the date (for example,\\n“Archive  5-2-21”). There  was  always  a  moment  of  fear  and  hesitation  at  first. They  didn’t  want  anything  to  get  lost,  but  very  quickly,  as  they  saw  that  they\\nwould always be able to access anything from the past, I watched them come alive\\nwith a renewed sense of hope and possibility.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"90f77eda-9e8b-4d3a-9b89-1b6cc69d853e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"90f77eda-9e8b-4d3a-9b89-1b6cc69d853e\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"803f4930-3f70-4cb0-9114-732a429542b4\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"9801025a-5beb-4146-87ed-dd06f238eac6\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"They  had  repeatedly  postponed  their  creative  ambitions  to  some  far-off,\\nmythical time when somehow everything would be perfectly in order. Once we\\nset that aside and just focused on what they actually wanted to do right now, they\\nsuddenly gained a tremendous sense of clarity and motivation. For a while I was sure this would come back to haunt me. Eventually they’d\\nwant to go back and organize all those old files, right? I would often see the same\\npeople coming back to our store again and again. I waited expectantly in fear for\\nsomeone to return and accuse me of losing all their old files. Let me tell you: no one ever did. Not once did someone come back and say, “You know, I’d really like to go\\nback and organize all those files from my old computer.” What they did tell me\\nwere the stories of the impact their creative projects had: on their families, on their\\nbusiness, on their grades, on their career. One person organized a fundraising drive\\nfor  a  friend  who  had  recently  been  diagnosed  with  leukemia. Another  put\\ntogether a successful application for a small business loan to start a dance studio. One student told me that the ability to tame the chaos of her digital world was the\\nonly  reason  she  had  finished  college  as  the  first  graduate  from  her  family. The\\ndetails of how they organized their computer or took notes were trivial, but the\\nimpact their creativity had on their own lives and the lives of others—that was\\nanything but. There are a few lessons I took away from this experience. The first is that people need clear workspaces to be able to create. We cannot\\ndo  our  best  thinking  and  our  best  work  when  all  the  “stuff”  from  the  past  is\\ncrowding and cluttering our space. That’s why that archiving step is so crucial:\\nyou’re not losing anything, and it can all be found via search, but you need to\\nmove it all out of sight and out of mind. Second, I learned that creating new things is what really matters.

I’ve learned that completed creative projects are the blood flow of your Second\\nBrain. They  keep  the  whole  system  nourished,  fresh,  and  primed  for  action. It\\ndoesn’t  matter  how  organized,  aesthetically  pleasing,  or  impressive  your\\nnotetaking system is. It is only the steady completion of tangible wins that can\\ninfuse you with a sense of determination, momentum, and accomplishment. It\\ndoesn’t matter how small the victories. Even the tiniest breakthrough can become\\na stepping-stone to more creative, more interesting futures than you can imagine. Your Turn: Move Quickly, Touch Lightly\\n\\nA mentor of mine once gave me a piece of advice that has served me ever since:\\nmove quickly and touch lightly. She saw that my standard approach to my work was brute force: to stay late at\\nthe  office,  fill  every  single  minute  with  productivity, and  power  through\\nmountains of work as if my life depended on it. That wasn’t a path to success; it\\nwas a path to burnout. Not only did I exhaust my mental and physical reserves\\ntime and again; my frontal assaults weren’t even very effective. I didn’t know how\\nto set my intentions, craft a strategy, and look for sources of leverage that would\\nallow me to accomplish things with minimal effort. My mentor advised me to “move quickly and touch lightly” instead. To look\\nfor the path of least resistance and make progress in short steps. I want to give the\\nsame advice to you: don’t make organizing your Second Brain into yet another\\nheavy obligation. Ask yourself: “What is the smallest, easiest step I can take that\\nmoves me in the right direction?”\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9801025a-5beb-4146-87ed-dd06f238eac6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9801025a-5beb-4146-87ed-dd06f238eac6\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"90f77eda-9e8b-4d3a-9b89-1b6cc69d853e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"de6d53ec-90cd-4bc6-a46b-214b69eb3912\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"When it comes to PARA, that step is generally to create folders for each of\\nyour active projects in your notes app and begin to fill them with the content\\nrelated to those projects.

Each  time  you  finish  a  project,  move  its  folder\\nwholesale to the archives, and each time you start a new project, look through\\nyour archives to see if any past project might have assets you can reuse. As  you  create  these  folders  and  move  notes  into  them,  don’t  worry  about\\nreorganizing or “cleaning up” any existing notes. You can’t afford to spend a lot of\\ntime on old content that you’re not sure you’re ever going to need. Start with a\\n\\nclean slate by putting your existing notes in the archives for safekeeping. If you\\never need them, they’ll show up in searches and remain just as you left them. Your goal is to clear your virtual workspace and gather all the items related to\\neach  active  project  in  one  place.

Chapter 6\\nDistill—Find the Essence\\nTo attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, remove\\nthings every day. —Lao Tzu, ancient Chinese philosopher\\nIn 1969, studio executives at Paramount Pictures were desperate to find a film\\ndirector for a new movie they had purchased the rights to, a crime drama based on\\nthe New York Mafia. One  after  another,  all  the  top  directors  of  the  era  turned  the  project  down. They all found it too sensationalistic for their tastes. Gangster movies were known\\nas cliché and gimmicky, and there had been several recent duds in the genre. After exhausting all their top choices, studio executives approached a young\\nfilm director who had done a few small indie films. The director was a relative\\nnovice,  with  no  major  commercially  successful  films  to  his  name. He  was  an\\noutsider,  working  out  of  San  Francisco  instead  of  Hollywood,  the  industry\\ncapital. And he was known as an artist who wanted to experiment with new ideas,\\nnot a director of big budget movies. That director’s name was Francis Ford Coppola, and the movie he was asked to\\nmake was, of course, The Godfather. Coppola  initially  turned  down  the  project. As  recounted  in  the Hollywood\\nReporter,\\n1\\n he said, “It was more commercial and salacious than my own taste.” However, his partner and protégé George Lucas (of future Star Wars fame) noted\\nthat they were broke. Without a major infusion of cash, they’d soon be evicted. Mounting  financial  pressure,  plus  a  second  reading  of  the  novel,  changed\\nCoppola’s  mind,  as  he  realized  that  it  could  be  framed  as  “a  story  that  was  a\\n\\nmetaphor for American capitalism in the tale of a great king with three sons.” The  Godfather  would  go  on  to  become  one  of  the  greatest  critical  and\\ncommercial successes in filmmaking history. In 2007 the American Film Institute\\nnamed it the third-best American movie of all time. 2\\n It ultimately grossed $245\\nmillion, won three Oscars, and spawned a series of sequels and spinoffs eaten up\\nby a rabid fan base obsessed with the story of the fictional Corleone family. Coppola’s  strategy  for  making  the  complex,  multifaceted  film  rested  on  a\\ntechnique he learned studying theater at Hofstra College, known as a “prompt\\nbook.” He started by reading The  Godfather novel and capturing the parts that\\nresonated with him in a notebook—his own version of Twyla Tharp’s box. But\\nhis prompt book went beyond storage: it was the starting point for a process of\\nrevisiting and refining his sources to turn them into something new. The book was made from a three-ring binder, into which he would cut and\\npaste pages from the novel on which the film was based. It was designed to last,\\nwith  reinforced  grommets  to  ensure  the  pages  wouldn’t  tear  even  after  many\\nturnings. There he could add the notes and directions that would later be used to\\nplan the screenplay and production design of the film. In  a  short  documentary  titled Francis  Coppola’s  Notebook\\n3\\n  released  in  2001,\\nCoppola explained his process. He started with an initial read of the entire novel,\\nnoting down anything that stuck out to him: “I think it’s important to put your\\nimpressions down on the first reading because those are the initial instincts about\\nwhat you thought was good or what you didn’t understand or what you thought\\nwas bad.”\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"96f81fdf-c0e1-4c5e-8a21-669cf477a1e1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"96f81fdf-c0e1-4c5e-8a21-669cf477a1e1\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"de6d53ec-90cd-4bc6-a46b-214b69eb3912\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"eac95379-ff36-4d02-a68f-d961b3db2c55\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Coppola  then  began  to  add  his  own  interpretations,  distilling  and\\nreconstituting his own version of the story. He broke down each scene according\\nto five key criteria: a synopsis (or summary) of the scene; the historical context; the\\nimagery and tone for the “look and feel” of a scene; the core intention; and any\\npotential pitfalls to avoid. In his own words, “I endeavored to distill the essence of\\neach scene into a sentence, expressing in a few words what the point of the scene\\nwas.” Coppola described his binder as “a kind of multi-layered road map for me to\\ndirect the film... so I was able to review not only Mario Puzo’s original text but all\\nmy first notation as to what... was important to me or what I felt was really going\\n\\non in the book.” His comments in the margins included “Hitchcock” to remind\\nhim of how the famed director of thrillers would have framed a shot, or “Frozen\\ntime”  to  remind  him  to  slow  down  a  sequence. He  used  different  kinds  of\\nannotations  to  emphasize  to  his  future  self  which  parts  of  a  scene  were  most\\nimportant: “As I was reading the book and making these notes and then putting\\nthem on the margins obviously the more pens I was using and the more rulers,\\nand the more squiggly lines, sort of implied the excitement of the book was higher\\nand higher, so that the sheer amount of ink on the page would tell me later on this\\nis one of the most important scenes.” The Godfather Notebook is a perfect example of the behind-the-scenes process\\nused by successful creative professionals. Coppola considered the prompt book\\nthat emerged from this process the most important asset in the production of his\\nnow classic film: “the script was really an unnecessary document; I didn’t need a\\nscript because I could have made the movie just from this notebook.” We might imagine a movie as emerging straight out of the mind of a screenplay\\nwriter  or  director,  when  in  fact  it  depends  on  collecting  and  refining  source\\nmaterial. Coppola’s story demonstrates that we can systematically gather building\\nblocks  from  our  reading  and  research  that  ultimately  make  the  final  product\\nricher, more interesting, and more impactful. If  Francis  Ford  Coppola  relied  so  much  on  a  step-by-step  process  for\\nnotetaking, then so can we. We can also use our notes to drill down to the essence\\nof the stories, research, examples, and metaphors that make up our own source\\nmaterial. This is the third step of CODE, to Distill. This is the moment we begin\\nturning the ideas we’ve captured and organized into our own message. It all begins\\nand ends with notes. Quantum Notetaking: How to Create Notes for an Unknown\\nFuture\\nI’ve  shown  you  how  to  capture  notes  with  interesting  ideas  from  the  outside\\nworld  or  your  own  thoughts. You  may  have  started  organizing  those  notes\\naccording to their actionability and relevance to your current projects. Now what? This is where even the most dedicated notetakers usually stop. They aren’t sure\\nwhat to do next. They’ve gathered some interesting knowledge, but it hasn’t led\\nanywhere. Our notes are things to use, not just things to collect. When you initially capture a note, you may have only seconds to get it into\\nyour Second Brain before the next meeting, urgent task, or crying child comes\\ncalling. Not  nearly  enough  time  to  fully  understand  what  it  means  or  how  it\\nmight be used. When you first capture them, your notes are like unfinished pieces\\nof  raw  material. They  require  a  bit  more  refinement  to  turn  them  into  truly\\nvaluable  knowledge  assets,  like  a  chemist  distilling  only  the  purest  compound.

How likely is it that life will\\nintervene, in the form of a crisis at work, an urgent meeting at your kid’s school,\\nor an unexpected cold? In my experience, life is constantly pushing and pulling us\\naway from our priorities.

Your  job  as  a\\nnotetaker is to preserve the notes you’re taking on the things you discover in such\\na way that they can survive the journey into the future. That way your excitement\\nand enthusiasm for your knowledge builds over time instead of fading away. Discoverability—The Missing Link in Making Notes Useful\\nThe most important factor in whether your notes can survive that journey into\\nthe future is their discoverability—how easy it is to discover what they contain and\\naccess the specific points that are most immediately useful. Discoverability is an idea from information science that refers to “the degree to\\nwhich  a  piece  of  content  or  information  can  be  found  in  a  search  of  a  file,\\ndatabase,  or  other  information  system.” I\\n  Librarians  think  about  discoverability\\nwhen deciding how to lay out books on the shelves. Web designers think about it\\nwhen  they  create  menus  for  the  websites  you  visit  every  day. Social  media\\nplatforms work hard to make the best content on their platforms as discoverable\\nas possible. Discoverability is the element most often missing from people’s notes. It’s easy\\nto save tons and tons of content, but turning it into a form that will be accessible\\nin the future is another matter. To enhance the discoverability of your notes, we\\ncan turn to a simple habit you probably remember from school: highlighting the\\nmost  important  points. Highlighting  is  an  activity  that  everyone  understands,\\ntakes hardly any additional effort, and works in any app you might use. Imagine  your  future  self  as  a  demanding  customer.

In that sense,\\neach note is like a product you are creating for the benefit of that future customer.

You distill your message down to the key points and action\\nsteps.

How could you\\ncommunicate with them through time in the most efficient, concise way? Highlighting 2. 0: The Progressive Summarization Technique\\nProgressive Summarization is the technique I teach to distill notes down to their\\nmost  important  points. It  is  a  simple  process  of  taking  the  raw  notes  you’ve\\ncaptured and organized and distilling them into usable material that can directly\\ninform a current project. Progressive Summarization takes advantage of a tool and a habit that we are all\\nintimately familiar with—highlighting—while leveraging the unique capabilities\\n\\nof technology to make those highlights far more useful than anything you did in\\nschool. The technique is simple: you highlight the main points of a note, and then\\nhighlight the main points of those highlights, and so on, distilling the essence of a\\nnote in several “layers.” Each of these layers uses a different kind of formatting so\\nyou can easily tell them apart. Here is a snapshot of the four layers of Progressive Summarization:\\nII\\nHere’s an example of a note I captured from an article in Psychology Today. 4\\n I\\ncame across the link when it was shared on social media and saved it with two\\nclicks to my read later app, where I collect bookmarks of everything I want to\\nread, watch, or listen to. A few evenings later, when I wanted to do some casual\\nreading to wind down for the day, I read the article and highlighted the passages I\\nfound most interesting. I have my read later app synced to my digital notes app, so\\nany passage I highlight there automatically gets saved in my notes, including a link\\nto the source. This  is  what  I  call  “layer  one”—the  chunks  of  text  initially  captured  in  my\\nnotes. Notice that I didn’t save the entire article—only a few key excerpts. III\\n By\\nlimiting what I keep to only the best, most important, most relevant parts, I’m\\nmaking  all  the  subsequent  steps  of  organizing,  distilling,  and  expressing  much\\neasier. If I ever need to know the full details, I have the link to the original article\\nright there at the bottom. As interesting as this content is, it’s not nearly succinct enough. Once again, in\\nthe  midst  of  a  chaotic  workday,  I  would  be  hard-pressed  to  find  the  time  to\\ncasually  look  through  multiple  paragraphs  of  text  to  find  the  relevant  points.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"98fad648-fa85-479a-b1fa-c3f67765738d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"98fad648-fa85-479a-b1fa-c3f67765738d\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"3e9957e2-b70b-40c9-84ba-1b1f0e48d0fd\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"44dc2783-d414-440f-95ce-ae6f464e3b53\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Unless I highlight those points in a way that my future self can instantly grasp, I’ll\\nlikely never see them again. To enhance the discoverability of this note, I need to add a second layer of\\ndistillation. I usually do this when I have free time during breaks or on evenings or\\nweekends, when I come across the note while working on other projects, or when\\nI don’t have the energy for more focused work. All I have to do is bold the main\\n\\npoints within the note. This could include keywords that provide hints of what\\nthis text is about, phrases that capture what the original author was trying to say,\\nor sentences that especially resonated with me even if I can’t explain why. Looking\\nover the bolded parts of the same note below, can you see how much easier it is to\\nquickly grasp the gist of this note by looking only at those parts? At layer two, this note is already dramatically more discoverable. Imagine the\\ndifference  between  reading  the  original  article,  which  might  take  five  to  ten\\nminutes  of  focused  attention,  versus  glancing  over  these  bolded  points,  which\\nwould take less than a minute. We’re  not  done  yet! For  those  notes  that  are  especially  long,  interesting,  or\\nvaluable, it is sometimes worth adding a third layer of highlighting. I advise using\\nthe “highlighting” feature offered by most notes apps, which paints passages in\\nbright  yellow  just  like  the  fluorescent  highlighters  we  used  in  school  (which\\nappear in light gray below). If your notes app doesn’t have a highlighting feature,\\n\\nyou can use underlining or another kind of formatting instead. Look only at the\\nbolded passages you identified in layer two and highlight only the most interesting\\nand  surprising  of  those  points. This  will  often  amount  to  just  one  or  two\\nsentences that encapsulate the message of the original source. Looking at the note above, can you see how those few highlighted sentences\\njump out and catch your eye? They convey the main message of this article in a\\nhighly distilled form that takes just seconds to grasp. When I come across this note\\nin the future—while doing a search or browsing the notes within a folder—I’ll be\\nable to decide in the blink of an eye whether this source is relevant to my needs. If\\nit is, I’ll have all the additional details and context I need to remember it right in\\nfront of me, as well as the link to the original article to check the source. There is one more layer we can add, though it is quite rarely needed. For only\\nthe  very  few  sources  that  are  truly  unique  and  valuable,  I’ll  add  an  “executive\\nsummary” at the top of the note with a few bullet points summarizing the article\\n\\nin my own words. The best sign that a fourth layer is needed is when I find myself\\nvisiting a note again and again, clearly indicating that it is one of the cornerstones\\nof my thinking. Looking only at the points I’ve previously bolded and highlighted\\nin  layers  two  and  three  makes  it  far  easier  to  write  this  summary  than  if  I  was\\ntrying to summarize the entire article all at once. I recommend using bullet points to encourage yourself to make this executive\\nsummary succinct. Use your own words, define any unusual terms you’re using,\\nand think about how your future self, who may not remember anything about\\nthis source, might interpret what you’re writing. By reviewing this executive summary, I can rapidly recall the main takeaways\\nfrom this article in a fraction of the time it would take to reread the original.

You want to pick\\nup where you left off, looking only at the highlights left over from the last time\\nyou  visited  that  note. You  can  review  all  the  details  at  layer  one,  or  if  you’re\\npressed for time (and when are we ever not pressed for time?) , just focus on layers\\ntwo, three, or four. You can customize how much attention you spend on a note\\nbased on your energy level and time available. It’s  like  having  a  digital  map  of  your  notes  that  can  be  zoomed  in  or  out\\ndepending  on  how  many  details  you  want  to  see,  like  a  maps  app  on  your\\nsmartphone.

The same is true for your landscape of knowledge—sometimes you\\nwant to zoom in and examine one specific research finding, while other times you\\nwant to zoom out and see the broad sweep of an argument all at once. With Progressive Summarization, you are building up a map of the best ideas\\nfound in your Second Brain. Your highlights are like signposts and waypoints that\\nhelp you navigate through the network of ideas you’re exploring. You are building\\nthis map without moving anything or deleting anything. Every sentence gets left\\nright  where  you  found  it,  giving  you  the  freedom  to  leave  things  out  without\\nworrying that you’ll lose them. With this map in hand, you can actually see what\\nyou’ve  captured,  helping  you  find  what  you’re  looking  for  but  also  what  you\\ndon’t even know you’re looking for. Highlighting can sometimes feel risky. You may wonder, “Am I making the\\nright  decision  about  which  points  are  most  important,  or  what  this  source\\nmeans?” The multiple layers of Progressive Summarization are like a safety net; if\\nyou go in the wrong direction, or make a mistake, you can always just go back to\\nthe original version and try again. Nothing gets forgotten or deleted. Progressive Summarization helps you focus on the content and the presentation\\nof your notes,\\nIV\\n instead of spending too much time on labeling, tagging, linking,\\n\\nor  other  advanced  features  offered  by  many  information  management  tools. It\\ngives you a practical, easy thing to do that adds value even when you don’t have\\nthe energy for more challenging tasks. Most importantly, it keeps your attention\\non the substance of what you’re reading or learning, which is what matters in the\\nlong term. Four Examples of Progressive Summarization\\nProgressive Summarization can be used across a wide variety of different kinds of\\ncontent. As  long  as  a  source  can  be  turned  into  text,\\nV\\n  you  can  add  layers  of\\nhighlighting in any information management tool you use.

I was once on a panel when one of the speakers mentioned this term. Within\\nthe ten seconds before it was my turn to respond, I was able to run a search, look\\nup  this  note  on  my  tablet  (where  all  my  notes  are  synchronized),  and  speak\\nconfidently on the subject as if I had known it all along. Online Articles\\nMuch of the time we consume information without a specific purpose in mind. We might peruse the newspaper over breakfast, listen to a podcast while working\\nout,  or  check  out  a  newsletter  to  casually  learn  about  a  topic. We  consume\\ninformation to stay up to date, pass the time, entertain ourselves, and keep our\\nminds engaged. These moments are some of the most valuable opportunities to capture tidbits\\nof insight that you probably might not find otherwise. Because this casual reading\\nand listening tends to range over a wide number of topics and interests, you are\\nexposed to more diverse ideas than usual. One evening I was reading an online article that I saw shared on social media. The article explained how Google used “structured interviews”  as  part  of  their\\nhiring process to reduce bias, ensure consistency, and learn from past hires. I was a\\nsolo freelancer at the time and had no immediate use for knowledge about hiring\\npractices. I knew that someday I might, so I decided to save the paragraph you see\\nbelow to my Second Brain. Almost  two  years  later,  I  was  finally  ready  to  hire  my  first  employee. I\\nremember  the  feeling  of  anxiety  as  I  prepared  to  take  on  this  major  financial\\ncommitment,  not  to  mention  the  responsibility  of  managing  a  direct  report. Luckily, I had a handful of highly actionable notes saved in a resource folder called\\n“Hiring.” To  get  started,  I  moved  the  entire  folder  from  resources  to  projects. Then I spent about thirty minutes to review the notes it contained and highlight\\nthe  most  relevant  takeaways. Those  highlights  were  the  starting  point  for  the\\nhiring process I ended up using for my own business, inspired by one of the most\\ninnovative and desirable employers in the world. Podcasts and Audio\\nNotes can come in handy even when you’re not able to write them down in real\\ntime. I  was  driving  with  my  wife  one  weekend  to  a small  Airbnb  cabin  in  the\\nSierra Nevada mountains of California, and we decided to listen to a podcast. It\\nwas  a  casual  conversation  between  the  host  and  a  course  instructor  named\\nMeghan  Telpner,  who  ran  an  online  school  called  the  Academy  of  Culinary\\nNutrition. 5\\nI had never heard of her and put on the episode without any particular goal in\\nmind. Over the next hour, as we ascended the steep mountainside roads, we were\\ncaptivated by the story of the education business she had managed to build. She\\nhad faced so many of the same challenges we had. It was a relief to hear that we\\nweren’t alone in our struggles. I was driving and unable to write anything down,\\nbut as soon as we arrived I sat in the car for a few minutes and captured the ideas I\\n\\nremembered. This is actually a great way to filter down the volume of notes you’re\\ntaking—the best stuff always sticks in your mind for an hour or two. A few months later, we were preparing a launch campaign for a new version of\\nour online course. I had only a couple of weeks to prepare for it—definitely not\\nenough  time  to  do  more  research.

The highlighted passages you see here were\\nthe  sparks  that  eventually  led  to  us  hiring  alumni  of  the  course  to  coach  new\\nstudents.

You truly never know where\\ninspiration will come from and the extraordinary impact it can have. Meeting Notes\\nLike many people, I spend a fair percentage of my time on phone calls and in\\nmeetings. I want to make the best use of that time, so I take notes during most\\nmeetings of new ideas, suggestions, feedback, and action steps that come up. Taking notes during meetings is a common practice, but it’s often not clear\\nwhat we should do with those notes. They are often messy, with the action items\\nburied  among  random  comments. I  often  use  Progressive  Summarization  to\\nsummarize  my  notes  after  phone  calls  to  make  sure  I’m  extracting  every  bit  of\\nvalue from them. I  captured  this  note  during  a  conversation  with  a  friend  of  mine  who  has\\nexperience  designing  recording  studios. We  were  remodeling  our  garage  into  a\\nhome studio and I wanted to get his advice. He was kind enough to come over\\nand walk me through his recommendations, and I wrote down the main points in\\na notes app on my smartphone as he spoke. Sometime later, I happened to be driving by the local hardware store on my\\nway home. I realized that I could pop in and get some of the supplies my friend\\nhad recommended. I took out my smartphone, did a search for “home studio,”\\nand found this note. I took a few minutes while sitting in the car and bolded the\\nitems I would need to purchase at some point, which were buried among other\\nsuggestions he had made. Here’s what it looked like:\\n\\nI then copied and pasted only the bolded items I was ready to purchase into a\\nseparate list below my original notes, and suddenly I had a convenient shopping\\nlist I could easily reference while browsing the store. This example illustrates how even Progressively Summarizing notes from our\\nown conversations can be immensely useful. Often your own thoughts need some\\ndistillation before you can take action on them. Picasso’s Secret: Prune the Good to Surface the Great\\nWe can look at masters of creativity throughout history to see how distilling their\\nideas shaped their work. One of Pablo Picasso’s most famous drawings, created in 1945 and known as\\nPicasso’s  Bull, offers a master class in how distillation works. It is a sequence of\\nimages that he drew to study a bull’s essential form. The process of distillation\\nhappens in every art form, but this example is unusual in that Picasso preserved\\neach step of his process. Pablo  Picasso, Le  Taureau  (series  of  11  lithographs),  1945–46  (©  2021  Estate  of  Pablo  Picasso  /  Artists\\nRights Society (ARS), New York). Starting  with  the  top  left  image  and  moving  across  and  down,  Picasso\\ndeconstructed  the  shapes  of  the  bull  one  step  at  a  time. In  the  first  couple  of\\ndrawings,  he  adds  more  detail. The  horns  are  fuller,  the  tail  becomes  three-\\ndimensional,  and  the  hide  has  more  depth  and texture. Picasso  is  starting  by\\nbuilding up detail so that he has more options to choose from when it comes time\\nto take some away. The process of distillation begins with the fourth image. He outlines the main\\nmuscles of the animal using sharp white lines. Soft curves become more angular,\\nand the animal as a whole starts to take on a more geometric look.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2c19cfad-9e8c-4eb4-a017-e338f66eecbf":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2c19cfad-9e8c-4eb4-a017-e338f66eecbf\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"1758ac1a-88bd-4fcd-969b-2010a9eb7300\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"a3a2c845-e9a6-4078-a2b5-c4e5dfa763e7\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"In the fifth and\\nsixth  images,  the  drawing  starts  to  become  radically  simplified  as  Picasso  drops\\n\\nmost of the detail in the bull’s head and further simplifies its horns, tail, and legs. A thick white line representing the bull’s center of gravity is added, cutting across\\nthe animal from front to back. By  the  last  few  images,  the  bull  has  become  nothing  more  than  an\\ninterconnected  series  of  simple,  black-and-white  shapes. The  legs  have  become\\nsingle lines. Solid blocks of color define the front and back of the animal. In the\\nfinal drawings, even those details are abstracted away. We end with a drawing that\\nis  nothing  but  a  single,  continuous  stroke,  which  somehow  still  manages  to\\ncapture the very essence of the bull. 6\\nPicasso’s act of distillation involves stripping away the unnecessary so that only\\nthe essential remains. Crucially, Picasso couldn’t have started with the single line\\ndrawing. He needed to go through each layer of the bull’s form step-by-step to\\nabsorb the proportions and shapes into his muscle memory. The result points to a\\nmysterious aspect of the creative process: it can end up with a result that looks so\\nsimple, it seems like anyone could have made it. That simplicity masks the effort\\nthat was needed to get there. Another  example  comes  from  documentary  filmmaking. Ken  Burns,  the\\nrenowned creator of award-winning films like The Civil War, Baseball, and Jazz,\\nhas  said  that  only  a  tiny  percentage  of  the  raw  footage  he  captures  eventually\\nmakes it into the final cut. This ratio can be as high as 40- or 50-to-1, which means\\nthat for every forty to fifty hours of footage he captures, only one hour makes it\\ninto the final film. Along the way, Burns and his team are performing a radical act\\nof distillation—finding the most interesting, surprising, moving moments hidden\\namidst hundreds of hours of recordings. VI\\nProgressive  Summarization  is  not  a  method  for  remembering  as  much  as\\npossible—it is a method for forgetting as much as possible. As you distill your\\nideas, they naturally improve, because when you drop the merely good parts, the\\ngreat parts can shine more brightly. To be clear, it takes skill and courage to let the\\ndetails fall away. As Picasso’s bull and Burns’s documentaries illustrate, in making\\ndecisions about what to keep, we inevitably have to make decisions about what to\\nthrow away. You cannot highlight the main takeaways from an article without\\nleaving  some  points  out. You  cannot  make  a  highlight  reel  of  a  video  without\\n\\ncutting some of the footage. You cannot give an effective presentation without\\nleaving out some slides. The Three Most Common Mistakes of Novice Notetakers\\nHere are a few guidelines to help you avoid common pitfalls as you embark on\\nhighlighting your own notes. Mistake #1: Over-Highlighting\\nThe biggest mistake people make when they start to distill their notes is that they\\nhighlight  way  too  much. You  may  have  experienced  this  pitfall  in  school,\\nhighlighting paragraph after paragraph or entire pages  of  textbooks  in  the  vain\\nhope that you’d automatically be able to remember everything in yellow for the\\ntest. When it comes to notetaking for work, less is more. You can capture entire\\nbooks, articles with dozens of pages, or social media posts by the hundreds. No\\none will stop you, but you’ll quickly learn that such volume will only create a lot\\nmore work later on when you have to figure out what all that information means. If you’re going to capture everything, you might as well capture nothing. Remember  that  notes  are  not  authoritative  texts. You  don’t  need  to  and\\nshouldn’t include every tiny detail. They are more like bookmarks peeking out\\nfrom the pages of a book on the shelf, signaling to you, “Hey! There’s something\\ninteresting here!” You will always be able to go back and review the full, original\\nsource if needed.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a3a2c845-e9a6-4078-a2b5-c4e5dfa763e7":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a3a2c845-e9a6-4078-a2b5-c4e5dfa763e7\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"2c19cfad-9e8c-4eb4-a017-e338f66eecbf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"f57b71e5-ef9d-4ab6-940b-4132da0e5e87\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"You will always be able to go back and review the full, original\\nsource if needed. Your notes only solve the problem of rediscovering those sources\\nwhen you need them. A helpful rule of thumb is that each layer of highlighting should include no\\nmore than 10–20 percent of the previous layer. If you save a series of excerpts\\nfrom a book amounting to five hundred words, the bolded second layer should\\ninclude no more than one hundred words, and highlighted third layer no more\\nthan  twenty. This  isn’t  an  exact  science,  but  if  you  find  yourself  highlighting\\neverything, this rule should give you pause. Mistake #2: Highlighting Without a Purpose in Mind\\nThe most common question I hear about Progressive Summarization is “When\\nshould I be doing this highlighting?” The answer is that you should do it when\\nyou’re getting ready to create something. Unlike  Capture  and  Organize,  which  take  mere  seconds,  it  takes  time  and\\neffort  to  distill  your  notes. If  you  try  to  do  it  with  every  note up  front,  you’ll\\nquickly be mired in hours of meticulous highlighting with no clear purpose in\\nmind. You can’t afford such a giant investment of time without knowing whether\\nit will pay off. Instead,  wait  until  you  know  how  you’ll  put  the  note  to  use. For  example,\\nwhen I’m preparing to write a blog post or article, I’ll usually start by highlighting\\nthe most interesting points from a group of notes that I think will be relevant to\\nthe topic at hand. That way I have a predictable, not-too-difficult task to get me\\nwarmed  up  for  writing,  the  same  way  an  athlete  might  have  a  warm-up  and\\nstretching routine. When  I’m  about  to  get  on  a  call  with  my  lawyer,  I’ll  often  prepare  by\\nhighlighting  my  notes  from  our  last  call  and  drawing  out  decision  points  and\\naction items into an agenda. He always thinks I’m well prepared, when in fact I\\njust want to finish the call quickly to minimize the time I’m being billed for! You have to always assume that, until proven otherwise, any given note won’t\\nnecessarily ever be useful. You have no idea what your future self will need, want,\\nor be working on. This assumption forces you to be conservative in the time you\\nspend summarizing notes, doing so only when it’s virtually guaranteed that it will\\nbe worth it. The rule of thumb to follow is that every time you “touch” a note, you should\\nmake it a little more discoverable for your future self\\nVII\\n—by adding a highlight, a\\nheading,  some  bullets,  or  commentary. This  is  the  “campsite  rule”  applied  to\\ninformation—leave it better than you found it. This ensures that the notes you\\ninteract with most often will naturally become the most discoverable in a virtuous\\ncycle. Mistake #3: Making Highlighting Difficult\\n\\nDon’t worry about analyzing, interpreting, or categorizing each point to decide\\nwhether to highlight it. That is way too taxing and will break the flow of your\\nconcentration. Instead,  rely  on  your  intuition  to  tell  you  when  a  passage  is\\ninteresting, counterintuitive, or relevant to your favorite problems or a current\\nproject. Just as you listened for a feeling of internal resonance in deciding what content\\nto save in the first place, the same rule applies for the insights within the note. Certain passages will move you, pique your attention, make your heart beat faster,\\nor provoke you. Those are clear signals that you’ve found something important,\\nand  it’s  time  to  add  a  highlight. You  can  apply  the  same  criteria  I  introduced\\nearlier in Chapter 4, looking out for individual points that are surprising, useful,\\ninspiring, or personal to decide which ones are worth highlighting. When you learn the art of distillation, you will gain a lifelong skill that will\\nimpact every area of your life.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f57b71e5-ef9d-4ab6-940b-4132da0e5e87":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f57b71e5-ef9d-4ab6-940b-4132da0e5e87\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a3a2c845-e9a6-4078-a2b5-c4e5dfa763e7\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"924202a5-3263-4cee-97bb-fbf5fd4afd10\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Think of a storyteller who captivates you with every\\nword.

Notetaking gives you a way to deliberately practice the skill of distilling every day. Your Turn: Keep Your Future Self in Mind\\nThe effort we put into Progressive Summarization is meant for one purpose: to\\nmake it easy to find and work with our notes in the future. More is not better when it comes to thinking and creating. Distilling makes\\nour  ideas  small  and  compact,  so  we  can  load  them  up  into  our  minds  with\\nminimal  effort. If  you  can’t  locate  a  piece  of  information  quickly,  in  a  format\\n\\nthat’s convenient and ready to be put to use, then you might as well not have it at\\nall. Our most scarce resource is time, which means we need to prioritize our ability\\nto quickly rediscover the ideas that we already have in our Second Brain. When the opportunity arrives to do our best work, it’s not the time to start\\nreading books and doing research. You need that research to already be done. VIII\\nYou can prepare in advance for the future challenges and opportunities you don’t\\neven  yet  know  you’ll  face,  by  taking  advantage  of  the  effort  you’re  already\\nspending reading books, learning new things, and simply being curious about the\\nworld around you. To put what you’ve just learned into practice immediately, find an interesting\\npiece  of  content  you  consumed  recently,  such  as  an  article,  audiobook,  or\\nYouTube video. This could be content you’ve captured already and organized in\\none of your PARA folders. Or it could be a new piece of content floating around\\nyour email inbox or in a read later app. Start by saving only the best excerpts from that piece of content in a new note,\\neither using copy-paste or a capture tool. This is layer one, the initial excerpts you\\nsave  in  your  Second  Brain. Next,  read  through  the  excerpts,  bolding  the  main\\npoints  and  most  important  takeaways. Don’t  make  it  an  analytical  decision—\\nlisten for a feeling of resonance and let that be your guide for what to bold. These\\nbolded passages are layer two. Now read through only the bolded passages, and highlight (or, if your notes\\napp doesn’t have a highlighting feature, underline) the best of the best passages. The key here is to be very picky: the entire note may have only a few highlighted\\nsentences, or even just one. Not only is that fine, it represents a highly distilled and\\ndiscoverable note. These highlights are layer three, which is distilled enough for\\nmost use cases. The true test of whether a note you’ve created is discoverable is whether you\\ncan get the gist of it at a glance. Put it aside for a few days and set a reminder to\\nrevisit it once you’ve forgotten most of the details. When you come back to it, give\\nyourself no more than thirty seconds and see if you can rapidly get up to speed on\\nwhat it’s about using the highlights you previously made. You’ll quickly be able to\\ntell if you’ve added too many highlights or too few.

In the next chapter, we will move on to the final step of CODE, drawing on\\nthe material you’ve collected and distilled and using it to express your own point\\nof view. I. Discoverability, Wikipedia\\nII. I like to think of layer one as the “soil”—an excerpt from a source or my own thinking (whether as words,\\ndrawings,  images,  or  audio)  I  initially  capture  into  my  notes. They  are  like  the  ground  on  which  my\\nunderstanding will be built. Layer two is “oil,” as in “I’ve struck oil! ,” conveniently represented by black,\\nbolded text. Layer three is “gold,” which is even more valuable, and shines in highlighter yellow in many apps. Layer  four  is  the  “gems,”  the  most  rare  and  illuminating  finds  that  I’ve  distilled  in  my  own  words  as  an\\nexecutive summary. III. In  his  book A  New  Method  of  Making  Common-Place-Books, John  Locke  similarly advised  that  “We\\nextract only those Things which are Choice and Excellent, either for the Matter itself, or else the Elegancy of\\nthe Expression, and not what comes next.” IV. As humans we are exquisitely sensitive to the way information is presented. In web design, a slight change\\nof color for a button or a slightly reworded headline can easily have a double-digit impact on the number of\\nvisitors who click on it. Imagine if we put as much thought into how the information on our own devices is\\npresented  to  us  as  we  do  into  the  public  web. Even  something  as  simple  as  an  informative  heading,  a\\nparagraph break, or a highlighted phrase can make it dramatically easier to absorb a piece of text. V. Distillation also applies to other kinds of media such as images, audio, and video, but looks quite different\\nand is beyond the scope of this book. VI. In  a  class  on  documentary  filmmaking  on  the  educational  platform  MasterClass,  Burns  offered  his\\nsuggestions for keeping track of material related to a film project: “Is there an article in the newspaper that\\nrelates to your project? Cut it out and file it. Have you written a draft of narration or dialogue? Print it out\\nand file it. Thought of some great questions to ask your first interview subject? Jot them down on a scrap of\\npaper and file that too.” VII. This principle is called stigmergy—to leave “marks” on the environment that make your future efforts\\neasier. It is a strategy used by ant colonies to find food. If an ant finds a food source, it will bring a piece of it\\n\\nback to the colony, while leaving a special pheromone along the trail. Other ants can follow this trail to find\\nthe food for themselves, enabling a multitude of ants to quickly find and collect new sources of food. VIII. As Sönke Ahrens observes in his book How to Take Smart Notes, this is the fundamental paradox at the\\nheart of writing: you have to do the research before you know what you will write about. In his words: “We\\nhave to read with a pen in hand, develop ideas on paper and build up an ever-growing pool of externalised\\nthoughts. We will not be guided by a blindly made-up plan picked from our unreliable brains, but by our\\ninterest,  curiosity  and  intuition,  which  is  formed  and  informed  by  the  actual  work  of  reading,  thinking,\\ndiscussing,  writing  and  developing  ideas—and  is  something  that  continuously  grows  and  reflects  our\\nknowledge and understanding externally.” Chapter 7\\nExpress—Show Your Work\\nVerum ipsum factum (“We only know what we make”)\\n—Giambattista Vico, Italian philosopher\\nIn June 1947, a baby girl named Octavia Estelle Butler was born in Pasadena,\\nCalifornia.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"be17e7b6-135d-49d5-bfc1-5565f1412b46":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"be17e7b6-135d-49d5-bfc1-5565f1412b46\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"924202a5-3263-4cee-97bb-fbf5fd4afd10\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"06cc45f0-2d7f-4f09-98d6-b94fe8095887\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Known  in  her  early  years  as  simply  “Estelle,”  she  was  raised  by  a  single,\\nwidowed mother who worked domestic jobs to make ends meet. Painfully shy and\\nintroverted from a young age, Estelle became an easy target for bullying at school,\\nwhich led her to believe she was “ugly and stupid, clumsy, socially hopeless.” 1\\n Her\\nshyness combined with mild dyslexia made schoolwork difficult. In response, Estelle turned inward to her own imagination and outward to the\\nPasadena Central Library, where she would spend countless hours reading fairy\\ntales and horse stories, and later, the fantasy and science-fiction novels that would\\neventually inspire her to become a writer. Despite  the  odds  stacked  against  her,  this  young  woman  would  eventually\\nbecome one of the most successful and influential science-fiction writers of her\\ngeneration,  winning  multiple  Hugo  and  Nebula  awards  (the  genre’s  highest\\nhonors)  and  in  1995  becoming  the  first  sci-fi  writer  to  receive  a  MacArthur\\n“Genius” Fellowship. But  Estelle  wasn’t  always  so  successful. Her  teachers  at  Garfield  Elementary\\nSchool evaluated her earliest writing harshly, with comments like “Hyperbolic”\\nand  “You’re  not  even  trying”  scribbled  in  the  margins. 2\\n  An  elementary  school\\nteacher  once  asked,  “Why  include  the  science  fiction  touch? I  think  the  story\\nwould be more universal if you kept to the human, earthly touch.” The teacher\\n\\nreported to her mother that “She has the understanding, but doesn’t apply it. She\\nneeds to learn self-discipline.” When she was twelve years old, Estelle watched the 1954 film Devil Girl From\\nMars, a sensationalist B movie that was so terrible it convinced Estelle that she\\ncould write something better. She recalls, “Until I began writing my own stories, I\\nnever found quite what I was looking for... In desperation, I made up my own.” As  the  possibility  of  becoming  a  professional  writer  slowly  dawned  on  her,\\nEstelle  began  her  transformation  into  “Octavia,”  whom  she  thought  of  as  her\\npowerful, assertive alter ego. Octavia took on a series of temporary or part-time\\njobs after graduating from high school: clerical, factory, warehouse, laundry, and\\nfood  preparation  gigs—anything  that  wasn’t  too  mentally  taxing,  and  that\\nallowed  her  to  maintain  her  routine  of  waking  before  dawn  each  morning  to\\nwrite. The emerging Octavia made three rules for herself:\\n1. Don’t  leave  your  home  without  a  notebook,  paper  scraps,  something  to\\nwrite with. 2. Don’t walk into the world without your eyes and ears focused and open. 3. Don’t make excuses about what you don’t have or what you would do if\\nyou did, use that energy to “find a way, make a way.” Thus began a lifelong relationship with her commonplace books. Butler would\\nscrape  together  twenty-five  cents  to  buy  small  Mead  memo  pads,  and  in  those\\npages she took notes on every aspect of her life: grocery and clothes shopping lists,\\nlast-minute to-dos, wishes and intentions, and calculations of her remaining funds\\nfor rent, food, and utilities. She meticulously tracked her daily writing goals and\\npage  counts,  lists  of  her  failings  and  desired  personal  qualities,  her  wishes  and\\ndreams for the future, and contracts she would sign with herself each day for how\\nmany words she committed to write. Of course, Butler also gathered material for her fantastic stories: lyrics to songs\\nshe’d heard on the radio, an idea for a character’s name or motivation, a new topic\\nto research, details of news stories—everything she needed to build the worlds her\\n\\nstories would take place in. She studied dozens of topics—anthropology, English,\\njournalism, and speech.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"06cc45f0-2d7f-4f09-98d6-b94fe8095887":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"06cc45f0-2d7f-4f09-98d6-b94fe8095887\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"be17e7b6-135d-49d5-bfc1-5565f1412b46\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"839c1351-fdd6-4b65-a7e0-f2764be867ca\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"She studied dozens of topics—anthropology, English,\\njournalism, and speech. She traveled to the Amazon and Incan ruins in Peru to get\\na firsthand taste of biodiversity and civilizational collapse. Like a journalist, Butler\\nhad a love for cold, hard facts to imbue her stories with a sense of authenticity and\\nconcreteness: “The greater your ignorance the more verifiably accurate must be\\nyour facts,” she once remarked. One  of  Butler’s  novels, The  Parable  of  the  Sower,  hit  the New  York  Times\\nbestseller list for the first time in 2020,\\n3\\n fulfilling one of Butler’s life goals fourteen\\nyears after her death. The book portrays a postapocalyptic future in the aftermath\\nof runaway climate disasters, in which small communities must band together in\\norder  to  survive. These  eerily  prescient  forecasts  resonated  with  readers  as  the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic unfolded, as our own time began to seem similarly bleak\\nand uncertain. The radical reimagination of what life could look like in the midst\\nof a crisis was no longer idle speculation—it had become a daily preoccupation for\\npeople  around  the  world. Butler  has  been  called  a  prophet  for  her  ability  to\\nforecast  the  future,  but  she  always  said  that  her  work  came  from  simply\\nimagining,  “If  this  goes  on... it  extrapolates  from  current  technology,  current\\necological conditions, current social conditions, current practices of any sort. It\\noffers good possibilities—as well as warnings.” Butler  knew  that  science  fiction  was  more  than  entertainment. It  was  a\\ntransformative way of viewing the future. As one of the first Black women to gain\\nrecognition  in  the  sci-fi  genre,  Butler  explored  ideas  and  themes  that  had  been\\npreviously ignored: the potential consequences of environmental collapse due to\\nclimate  change,  corporate  greed  and  the  growing  gap  between  the  wealthy  and\\npoor, gender fluidity and the “othering” of marginalized groups, and criticism of\\nthe hierarchical nature of society, among other themes. Butler  pioneered  Afrofuturism,  a  genre  that  cast  African  Americans  as\\nprotagonists who embrace radical change in order to survive. Her stories allowed\\nher  readers  to  visualize  futures  in  which  marginalized  people  are  heroes,  not\\nvictims. Through her writing, she expanded our vision of the future to include the\\nuntold stories of the disenfranchised, the outcast, and the unconventional. How  do  we  know  so  much  about  even  the  tiniest  details  of  Butler’s  life? Because she kept it all—journals, commonplace books, speeches, library call slips,\\n\\nessay and story drafts, school notes, calendars, and datebooks as well as assorted\\nodds and ends like school progress reports, bus passes, yearbooks, and contracts. This collection contained 9,062 items and filled 386 boxes when it was donated to\\nthe Huntington Library in San Marino, California, after Butler’s passing. 4\\nHow  could  a  painfully  shy  little  girl  become  a  world-renowned,  award-\\nwinning  writer?

The myth of the writer sitting down before a completely blank page, or the\\nartist  at  a  completely  blank  canvas,  is  just  that—a  myth. Professional  creatives\\nconstantly  draw  on  outside  sources  of  inspiration—their  own  experiences  and\\nobservations,  lessons  gleaned  from  successes  and  failures  alike,  and  the  ideas  of\\nothers. If there is a secret to creativity, it is that it emerges from everyday efforts to\\ngather and organize our influences. How to Protect Your Most Precious Resource\\nAs knowledge workers, attention is our most scarce and precious resource. The creative process is fueled by attention at every step. It is the lens that allows\\nus to make sense of what’s happening, to notice what resources we have at our\\ndisposal, and to see the contribution we can make. The ability to intentionally and\\nstrategically allocate our attention is a competitive advantage in a distracted world. We have to jealously guard it like a valuable treasure. You have twenty-four hours in a day, but how many of those hours include\\nyour highest-quality attention? Some days are so frenetic and fragmented that you\\nmight  not  have  any  at  all. Attention  can  be  cultivated  but  also  destroyed—by\\ndistractions, interruptions, and environments that don’t protect it. The challenge\\nwe  face  in  building  a  Second  Brain  is  how  to  establish  a  system  for  personal\\nknowledge that frees up attention, instead of taking more of it. We’ve been taught that it’s important to work “with the end in mind.” We are\\ntold  that  it  is  our  responsibility  to  deliver  results,  whether  that  is  a  finished\\nproduct on store shelves, a speech delivered at an event, or a published technical\\ndocument. This is generally good advice, but there is a flaw in focusing only on the final\\nresults: all the intermediate work—the notes, the drafts, the outlines, the feedback\\n—tends  to  be  underappreciated  and  undervalued. The  precious  attention  we\\ninvested in producing that in-between work gets thrown away, never to be used\\nagain. Because we manage most of our “work-in-process” in our head, as soon as\\nwe finish the project and step away from our desks, all that valuable knowledge we\\nworked so hard to acquire dissolves from our memory like a sandcastle washed\\naway by the ocean waves. If we consider the focused application of our attention to be our greatest asset\\nas  knowledge  workers,  we  can  no  longer  afford  to  let  that  intermediate  work\\ndisappear. If we consider how precious little time we have to produce something\\nextraordinary in our careers, it becomes imperative that we recycle that knowledge\\nback into a system where it can become useful again. What are the knowledge assets you’re creating today that will be most reusable\\nin the future? What are the building blocks that will move forward your projects\\ntomorrow? How can you package up what you know in a form that you’ll be able\\nto revisit it again and again no matter what endeavors you take on in the future? The final stage of the creative process, Express, is about refusing to wait until\\nyou have everything perfectly ready before you share what you know. It is about\\nexpressing your ideas earlier, more frequently, and in smaller chunks to test what\\nworks and gather feedback from others. That feedback in turn gets drawn in to\\nyour Second Brain, where it becomes the starting point for the next iteration of\\nyour work.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f6a436e5-f068-4026-a2c3-785264b7e5dd":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f6a436e5-f068-4026-a2c3-785264b7e5dd\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"839c1351-fdd6-4b65-a7e0-f2764be867ca\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"546c09ca-f2b0-4519-95ba-91b847b67acc\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Intermediate Packets: The Power of Thinking Small\\nThe idea of dividing our work into smaller units isn’t new. You’ve probably heard\\nthis advice a hundred times: if you’re stuck on a task, break it down into smaller\\nsteps. Every  profession  and  creative  medium  has  its  own  version  of  “intermediate\\nsteps” on the way to full-fledged final works. For example:\\n“Modules” in software development\\n“Betas” tested by start-ups\\n“Sketches” in architecture\\n“Pilots” for television series\\n“Prototypes” made by engineers\\n“Concept cars” in auto design\\n“Demos” in music recording\\nEach of these terms is the equivalent of a “rough draft” you create as part of the\\nprocess of making something new. Here’s  what  most  people  miss:  it’s  not  enough  to  simply  divide  tasks  into\\nsmaller  pieces—you  then  need  a system  for  managing  those  pieces. Otherwise,\\nyou’re just creating a lot of extra work for yourself trying to keep track of them. That system is your Second Brain, and the small pieces of work-in-process it\\ncontains  I  call  “Intermediate  Packets.” Intermediate  Packets  are  the  concrete,\\n\\nindividual building blocks that make up your work. I\\n For example, a set of notes\\nfrom  a  team  meeting,  a  list  of  relevant  research  findings,  a  brainstorm  with\\ncollaborators, a slide deck analyzing the market, or a list of action items from a\\nconference  call. Any  note  can  potentially  be  used  as  an  Intermediate  Packet  in\\nsome larger project or goal. Think of a salesperson planning a new campaign for a health-branded energy\\ndrink. Sales  might  seem  like  the  kind  of  job  that  is  least  related  to  “knowledge\\nmanagement.” Isn’t it all about making calls, having meetings, sending pitches,\\nand closing deals? If we take a closer look, there are many building blocks such a sales job relies\\non. The company brochure, the sales prospectus, the cold-calling scripts, the list\\nof warm leads, notes from past calls with an important distributor—these are the\\nassets that a salesperson depends on for their performance. Like LEGO blocks, the more pieces you have, the easier it is to build something\\ninteresting. Imagine that instead of starting your next project with a blank slate,\\nyou started with a set of building blocks—research findings, web clippings, PDF\\nhighlights, book notes, back-of-the-envelope sketches—that represent your long-\\nterm effort to make sense of your field, your industry, and the world at large. Our time and attention are scarce, and it’s time we treated the things we invest\\nin—reports, deliverables, plans, pieces of writing, graphics, slides—as knowledge\\nassets  that  can  be  reused  instead  of  reproducing  them  from  scratch. Reusing\\nIntermediate  Packets  of  work  frees  up  our  attention  for  higher-order,  more\\ncreative  thinking. Thinking small  is  the  best  way  to  elevate  your  horizons  and\\nexpand your ambitions. There are five kinds of Intermediate Packets you can create and reuse in your\\nwork:\\nDistilled notes: Books or articles you’ve read and distilled so it’s easy to get\\nthe  gist  of  what  they  contain  (using  the  Progressive  Summarization\\ntechnique you learned in the previous chapter, for example). Outtakes: The material or ideas that didn’t make it into a past project but\\ncould be used in future ones.

If  you’re  a  lab  scientist  and  a  colleague  designs  the\\nperfect lab protocol, you can reuse and improve that document for your own use\\n(with their permission, of course). You  should  always  cite  your  sources  and  give  credit  where  credit  is  due. A\\nscientist doesn’t obscure her sources—she points to them so others can retrace her\\nfootsteps. We all stand on the shoulders of giants, and it’s smart to build on the\\nthinking they’ve done rather than try to reinvent the wheel. Making the shift to working in terms of Intermediate Packets unlocks several\\nvery powerful benefits. First, you’ll become interruption-proof because you are focusing only on one\\nsmall packet at a time, instead of trying to load up the entire project into your\\nmind at once. You become less vulnerable to interruptions, because you’re not\\ntrying to manage all the work-in-process in your head. Second, you’ll be able to make progress in any span of time. Instead of waiting\\nuntil  you  have  multiple  uninterrupted  hours—which,  let’s  face  it,  is  rare  and\\ngetting rarer—you can look at how many minutes you have free and choose to\\nwork on an IP that you can get done within that time, even if it’s tiny. Big projects\\n\\nand goals become less intimidating because you can just keep breaking them down\\ninto smaller and smaller pieces, until they fit right into the gaps in your day. Third, Intermediate Packets increase the quality of your work by allowing you\\nto collect feedback more often. Instead of laboring for weeks in isolation, only to\\npresent your results to your boss or client and find out you went in the wrong\\ndirection, you craft just one small building block at a time and get outside input\\nbefore  moving  forward. You’ll  find  that  people  give  much  better  feedback  if\\nthey’re included early, and the work is clearly in progress. Fourth, and best of all, eventually you’ll have so many IPs at your disposal that\\nyou can execute entire projects just by assembling previously created IPs. This is a\\nmagical experience that will completely change how you view productivity. The\\nidea of starting anything from scratch will become foreign to you—why not draw\\non the wealth of assets you’ve invested in in the past? People will marvel at how\\nyou’re able to deliver at such a high standard so consistently. They’ll wonder how\\nyou  find  the  time  to  do  so  much  careful  thinking,  when  in  fact  you’re  not\\nworking  harder  or  longer—all  you’re  doing  is  drawing  on  a  growing  library  of\\nIntermediate Packets stored in your Second Brain. If they are truly valuable assets,\\nthen they deserve to be managed, just like any other asset you possess. Intermediate Packets are really a new lens through which you can perceive the\\natomic units that make up everything you do. By “thinking small,” you can focus\\non creating just one IP each time you sit down to work, without worrying about\\nhow viable it is or whether it will be used in the exact way you envisioned.

If it’s a brand-new event,\\nor  you’ve  never  organized  a  conference  before,  it  might  seem  like  you  have  to\\nproduce everything from scratch. However, if you break down that mega-project\\ninto concrete chunks, suddenly the components that you’ll need become clear:\\nA conference agenda\\nA list of interesting breakout sessions\\nA checklist for streaming the keynote sessions\\nAn email announcing the conference to your network\\nAn invitation for people to be speakers or panelists\\nA conference website\\n\\nThese are some of the building blocks that you’ll need to be able to run the\\nconference. You could put them all on your to-do list and make them yourself,\\nbut there’s a different, much faster, and more effective approach. Ask yourself:\\nHow could you acquire or assemble each of these components, instead of having\\nto make them yourself? The conference agenda could easily be modeled on an agenda from a different\\nconference,  with  the  topics  and  speaker  names  switched  out. You  could  start\\ncompiling  a  list  of  potential  breakout  sessions,  adding  any  topic  suggested  by\\nothers  that  strikes  you  as  interesting. You  might  have  a  checklist  for  delivering\\neffective keynotes left over from a live event you’ve organized in the past. Emails\\ncan draw on an archive of examples you’ve saved from other conferences you’ve\\nattended. Screenshots  of  conference  websites  you  admire  are  the  best  possible\\nstarting point for designing your own. Our creativity thrives on examples. When we have a template to fill in, our\\nideas are channeled into useful forms instead of splattered around haphazardly. There are best practices and plentiful models for almost anything you might want\\nto make. Most professionals I work with already have and use Intermediate Packets—\\nthat’s the point! Your Second Brain is the repository of things you are already\\ncreating and using anyway. All we are doing is adding a little bit of structure and\\nintentionality to how we use them: capturing them in one place, such as a digital\\nnotes app, so we can find them with a search; organizing them according to our\\nprojects,  areas,  and  resources,  so  we  have  a  dedicated  place  for  each  important\\naspect of our lives; and distilling them down to their most essential points, so they\\ncan be quickly accessed and retrieved. Once  we’ve  completed  these  initial  steps,  expression  transforms  from  a  gut-\\nwrenching,  agonizing  feat  to  a  straightforward  assembly  of  existing  packets  of\\nwork. Over time, your ability to quickly tap these creative assets and combine them\\ninto something new will make all the difference in your career trajectory, business\\ngrowth, and even quality of life. In the short term, it might not matter. You might\\nbe able to scramble and put together a particular document right when you need\\nit, but there will be a slowly accumulating, invisible cost. The cost of not being\\n\\nquite  sure  whether  you  have  what  you  need.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"93ae1421-83ab-46a1-8e48-6d536f4e510d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"93ae1421-83ab-46a1-8e48-6d536f4e510d\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"2c24104f-756a-4620-b3bb-f88de6aadbcf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"30995b35-f120-4abe-be65-607d8963a911\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"The  stress  of  wondering  whether\\nyou’ve already completed a task before.

How to Resurface and Reuse Your Past Work\\nThe Express step is where we practice and hone our ability to retrieve what we\\nneed,  when  we  need  it. It’s  the  step  where  we  build  the  confidence  that  our\\nSecond Brain is working for us. Let’s  take  a  closer  look  at  the  process  of  retrieval:  How  can  you  find  and\\nretrieve Intermediate Packets when you need them? This isn’t a trivial question, because the connection between IPs we’ve saved in\\nthe past and future projects is often quite unpredictable. A concert poster on the\\nside  of  a  building  you  snapped  a  photo  of  might  inform  the  shapes  in  a  logo\\nyou’re designing. A song overheard on the subway might influence a jingle you’re\\nwriting for your child’s school play. An idea about persuasion you read in a book\\nmight become a central pillar in a health campaign you are organizing for your\\ncompany. These are some of the most valuable connections—when an idea crosses the\\nboundaries  between  subjects. They  can’t  be  planned  or  predicted. They  can\\nemerge  only  when  many  kinds  of  ideas  in  different  shapes  and  sizes  are  mixed\\ntogether. This inherent unpredictability means that there is no single, perfectly reliable\\nretrieval  system  for  the  ideas  contained  in  your  notes. Instead,  there  are  four\\nmethods for retrieval that overlap and complement one another. Together they\\nare more powerful than any computer yet more flexible than any human mind. You can step through them in order until you find what you’re looking for. Those four retrieval methods are:\\n1. Search\\n2. Browsing\\n\\n3. Tags\\n4. Serendipity\\nRetrieval Method #1: Search\\nThe  search  function  in  your  notes  app  is  incredibly  powerful. The  same\\ntechnology that has revolutionized how we navigate the web via search engines is\\nalso useful for navigating our private knowledge collections. Search has the benefit of costing almost nothing in terms of time and effort. Just by saving your notes in a central place, you enable software to search their full\\ncontents in seconds. You can run multiple searches in quick succession, running\\ndown  rabbit  trails  through  your  knowledge  garden  as  you  try  out  different\\nvariations of terms. This  quick,  iterative  approach  to  searching  is  where  notes  apps  shine—you\\ndon’t have to open and close individual notes one at a time as in traditional word\\nprocessing. In a sense, every note in your Second Brain is already “open,” and you\\ncan view or interact with its contents with a mere click or tap. Search should be the first retrieval method you turn to. It is most useful when\\nyou  already  know  more  or  less  what  you’re  looking  for,  when  you  don’t  have\\nnotes saved in a preexisting folder, or when you’re looking for text, but as with\\nevery tool, it has its limitations. If you don’t know exactly what you’re looking for,\\ndon’t  have  a  preexisting folder  to  look  through,  or  are  interested  in  images  or\\ngraphics, it’s time to turn to browsing. Retrieval Method #2: Browsing\\nIf  you’ve  followed  the  PARA  system  outlined  in  Chapter  5  to  organize  your\\nnotes,  you  already  have  a  series  of  dedicated  folders  for  each  of  your  active\\nprojects, areas of responsibility, resources, and archives. Each  of  these  folders  is  a  dedicated  environment  designed  specifically  for\\nfocusing  on  that  domain  of  your  life.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"30995b35-f120-4abe-be65-607d8963a911":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"30995b35-f120-4abe-be65-607d8963a911\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"93ae1421-83ab-46a1-8e48-6d536f4e510d\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"afcc930f-9c2b-4a81-9ee9-8377a0db7ef6\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Each  one  can  contain  a  wide  range  of\\ncontent, from brief notes dashed off during a phone call to polished Intermediate\\nPackets that you’ve already used in past projects. When the time comes to take\\n\\naction,  you’ll  be  able  to  enter  the  appropriate  workspace  and  know  that\\neverything found there is relevant to the task at hand. As  powerful  as  search  can  be,  studies\\n5\\n  have  found  that  in  many  situations\\npeople  strongly  prefer  to  navigate  their  file  systems  manually,  scanning  for  the\\ninformation they’re looking for. Manual navigation gives people control over how\\nthey navigate, with folders and file names providing small contextual clues about\\nwhere to look next. 6\\n Browsing allows us to gradually home in on the information\\nwe are looking for, starting with the general and getting more and more specific. This  kind  of  browsing  uses  older  parts  of  the  brain  that  developed  to  navigate\\nphysical environments, and thus comes to us more naturally. II\\nThere are a variety of features offered by notes apps that make it easy to browse\\nyour hierarchy of folders. Some apps allow you to “sort” a list of notes by different\\ncriteria, such as date created. This gives you an interactive timeline of your ideas\\nfrom  newest  to  oldest. Other  apps  allow  you  to  show  only  images  and  web\\nclippings, enabling rapid visual scanning to see if anything catches your eye. Most\\nnotes apps allow you to open multiple windows and compare their contents side\\nby side so you can look for patterns and move content between them. Once again, there are limitations to what you can find by browsing folders. Sometimes you know a project is coming and can start saving things to a project\\nfolder in advance, but sometimes you don’t. Sometimes it’s very clear which area\\nof your business a note is related to, but often you have no idea where to put it. Many  notes  end  up  being  useful  in  completely  unexpected  ways. We  want  to\\nencourage that kind of serendipity, not fight it! It is for the unforeseen and the unexpected that tags really shine. Retrieval Method #3: Tags\\nTags are like small labels you can apply to certain notes regardless of where they\\nare located. Once they are tagged, you can perform a search and see all those notes\\ntogether in one place. The main weakness of folders is that ideas can get siloed\\nfrom  each  other,  making  it  hard  to  spark  interesting  connections. Tags  can\\novercome this limitation by infusing your Second Brain with connections, making\\n\\nit  easier  to  see  cross-disciplinary  themes  and  patterns  that  defy  simple\\ncategorization. For example, maybe you work in customer service and notice that the same\\nquestions from customers keep coming up again and again. You might decide to\\nwrite a Frequently Asked Questions page and add it to your company website. That is a project, but not one that you previously recognized and started gathering\\nmaterials for. You might have various notes that you want to draw on to design\\nthis  page,  but don’t  want  to  move  them  from  the  project,  area,  and  resource\\nfolders where they’re currently located. It’s  time  for  tags. You  could  take  fifteen  minutes  and  perform  a  series  of\\nsearches for terms relevant to the FAQs you’ll be writing. For any useful note you\\nfind, apply a tag called “FAQ” while leaving it right where you found it. Once\\nyou’ve found enough material to work with, you can perform a single search—for\\nthe  “FAQ”  tag—and  instantly  see  all  the  notes  you’ve  tagged  collected  in  one\\nplace. Now you are free to review them more closely, highlight any specific points\\nyou want to use, and move those points into an outline to guide your writing. I don’t recommend using tags as your primary organizational system. It takes\\nfar too much energy to apply tags to every single note compared to the ease of\\nsearching  with  keywords  or  browsing  your  folders.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"afcc930f-9c2b-4a81-9ee9-8377a0db7ef6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"afcc930f-9c2b-4a81-9ee9-8377a0db7ef6\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"30995b35-f120-4abe-be65-607d8963a911\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"fd33bf8b-0a8e-441d-8ec6-03a3d2f96b00\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"However,  tags  can  come  in\\nhandy in specific situations when the two previous retrieval methods aren’t up to\\nthe task, and you want to spontaneously gather, connect, and synthesize groups of\\nnotes on the fly. III\\nRetrieval Method #4: Serendipity\\nThe fourth retrieval method is the most mysterious but, in many ways, the most\\npowerful. Beyond  searching,  browsing,  and  tagging,  there  is  a  frontier  of\\npossibility that simply cannot be planned or predicted by human minds. There\\nare  moments  when  it  feels  like  the  stars  align  and  a  connection  between  ideas\\njumps out at you like a bolt of lightning from a blue sky. These are the moments\\ncreatives live for. There is no way to plan for them, but that doesn’t mean we can’t create the\\nideal  conditions  for  them  to  arise. This  is  the  main  reason we  put  all  sorts  of\\n\\ndifferent kinds of material, on many subjects and in diverse formats, all jumbled\\ntogether  in  our  Second  Brain. We  are  creating  a  soup  of  creative  DNA  to\\nmaximize the chance that new life emerges. Serendipity takes a few different forms when it comes to retrieval. First, while using the previous retrieval methods, it is a good idea to keep your\\nfocus a little broad. Don’t begin and end your search with only the specific folder\\nthat matches your criteria. Make sure to look through related categories, such as\\nsimilar projects, relevant areas, and different kinds of resources. When starting a project, I’ll often look at five or six PARA folders just in case\\nthey  contain  something  useful. Since  you’ve  carefully  curated  the  contents  of\\nthese  folders,  you  won’t  be  faced  with  too  much  material  in  any  given  one. If\\nyou’re  using  Progressive  Summarization  to  distill  your  notes,  as  explained  in\\nChapter 6, you can focus only on the highlighted passages and review notes far\\nfaster than having to read every word. It usually takes me less than thirty seconds\\non  average  to  review  a  highlighted  note,  which  means  I  can  set  aside  just  ten\\nminutes and review twenty of them or more. Second,  serendipity  is  amplified  by  visual  patterns. This  is  why  I  strongly\\nsuggest saving not only text notes but images as well (which is difficult to do in\\nother kinds of software such as word processors). Our brains are naturally attuned\\nto visuals. We intuitively absorb colors and shapes in the blink of an eye, using far\\nless  energy  than  it  takes  to  read  words. Some  digital  notes  apps  allow  you  to\\ndisplay only the images saved in your notes, which is a powerful way of activating\\nthe more intuitive, visual parts of your brain. Third, sharing our ideas with others introduces a major element of serendipity. When  you  present  an  idea  to  another  person,  their  reaction  is  inherently\\nunpredictable. They will often be completely uninterested in an aspect you think\\nis utterly fascinating; they aren’t necessarily right or wrong, but you can use that\\nfeedback either way. The reverse can also happen. You might think something is\\nobvious,  while  they  find  it  mind-blowing. That  is  also  useful  feedback. Others\\nmight  point  out  aspects  of  an  idea  you  never  considered,  suggest  looking  at\\nsources you never knew existed, or contribute their own ideas to make it better. All these forms of feedback are ways of drawing on not only your first and Second\\nBrains, but the brains of others as well. Three Stages of Expressing: What Does It Look Like to Show\\nOur Work? In Chapter 3, I explained how people tend to move through three distinct stages\\nas they grow their Second Brain and refine their knowledge management skills—\\nremembering, connecting, and creating. Let’s  look  at  examples  of  how  each  of  these  can  play  out  using  case  studies\\nfrom former students of mine.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"fd33bf8b-0a8e-441d-8ec6-03a3d2f96b00":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"fd33bf8b-0a8e-441d-8ec6-03a3d2f96b00\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"afcc930f-9c2b-4a81-9ee9-8377a0db7ef6\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"4e5a1495-e211-4446-a284-d9c352db0a4b\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Remember: Retrieve an Idea Exactly When It’s Needed\\nBenigno is a father and business consultant in the Philippines, and one of his goals\\nfor  building  a  Second  Brain  was  to  better  understand  the  emerging\\ncryptocurrency trend. He had tried other organizing methods before but found\\nthat the information he collected was always difficult to access. Time and again,\\nhe would “keep reading and bookmarking, then forget about it.” Benigno came across an article on an innovative new kind of cryptocurrency\\nand took a few minutes to save some excerpts from it in his notes. When a few of\\nhis friends became interested in the topic, he took eight minutes to progressively\\nsummarize the best excerpts before sharing the summarized article with them. The\\ntime that he had spent reading and understanding a complex subject paid off in\\ntime savings for his friends, while also giving them a new interest to connect over. In  Benigno’s  words,  “I  instinctively  knew  that  just  sending  a  long  article  to\\nfriends usually doesn’t do anything, but because the text I am sending has been\\nhighlighted they can do a quick scan of it. Also I now have material for a future\\narticle I have been planning... all thanks to CODE.” You don’t need to invent a new theory or write the next great novel to derive\\nvalue from your Second Brain. Within days of capturing ideas that resonate with\\nyou, you’ll start to notice opportunities to share them with others to their benefit. Connect: Use Notes to Tell a Bigger Story\\n\\nPatrick is a church pastor in Colorado, and he uses his Second Brain to help him\\ndesign  memorial  services,  which  for  him  are  a  deeply  creative  experience  about\\nhonoring life. His goal with creating a memorial service is to “tell the story of someone’s life\\nin  a  way  that  honors  and  makes  meaning  in  retrospect  about  how  their  life\\nunfolded.” In the past, this entailed a heavy lift. But by seeing his services through\\nthe lens of his Second Brain, Patrick realized that his job was simply to gather and\\nconnect some of the themes and stories he heard in a way that was meaningful to\\nthe deceased person’s loved ones. Patrick used this realization to change his creative process. He began recording\\nhis  conversations  using  an  automatic  transcription  app  on  his  smartphone,\\nallowing him to be fully present with grieving families knowing he had every word\\ncaptured. He  saved  all  the  transcripts  from  his  conversations,  plus  obituaries,\\nphotos,  and  other  related  documents  into  the  PARA  project  folder  for  each\\nmemorial, so he could see it all in one place. Instead of spending five to seven\\nhours at the end of all his interviews to distill everything he had heard, he began\\nspending  fifteen  minutes  after  each  interview  to  highlight  only  the  parts  that\\nresonated. In Patrick’s words: “Using my first brain only for what it is best at is freedom. Freedom to be present and not multitasking as I sit with grieving people hearing\\nstories of their loved ones. Freedom to know I have everything recorded. Freedom\\nto know that when I go to pull the memorial together, 80 percent of the work is\\nalready done.” IV\\nCreative expression isn’t always about self-promotion or advancing our own\\ncareer. Some of our most beautiful, creative acts are ones in which we connect the\\ndots for others in ways they wouldn’t be able to do themselves.

In Rebecca’s words: “I’m able to look at my priorities—my priorities for my\\nwork, my priorities for my family, my marriage, etc. —and then only focus in the\\nmoment on those projects that are on my plate now.” Whatever  you  are  responsible  for  creating—whether  it  is  documents  or\\npresentations or decisions or outcomes—your Second Brain is a vital repository of\\nall the bits and pieces you’ll want in front of you when you sit down to focus. It is\\na creative environment you can step into at any time, in any place, when it’s time\\nto make things happen. Creativity Is Inherently Collaborative\\nA  common  myth  of  creativity  is  that  of  the  solitary  artist,  working  in  total\\nisolation. We  are  implicitly  told  that  we  must  shut  ourselves  off  from  the\\ninfluence of others and flesh out our masterpiece by the sweat of our brow. In my experience, this isn’t how creativity works at all. It doesn’t matter what\\nmedium  you  work  in;  sooner  or  later  you  must  work  with  others. If  you’re  a\\nmusician, you’ll need a sound engineer to mix the record. If you’re an actor, you’ll\\nneed  a  director  who  believes  in  you. Even  writing  a  book,  which  may  suggest\\nimages of a lonely cabin deep in the woods, is an intensively social exercise. A book\\nis created out of a dance between an author and their editor. Reframing your work in terms of Intermediate Packets isn’t just about doing\\nthe same old stuff in smaller chunks. That doesn’t unlock your true potential. The\\n\\ntransformation  comes  from  the  fact  that  smaller  chunks  are  inherently  more\\nshareable and collaborative. It is much easier to show someone a small thing, and ask for their thoughts on\\nit,  rather  than  the  entire  opus  you’re  creating. It’s  less  confronting  to  hear\\ncriticism on one small aspect of your work, at an early stage when you still have\\ntime to correct it, than getting a negative reaction after months of effort. You can\\nuse each little piece of intermediate feedback to refine what you’re making—to\\nmake it more focused, more appealing, more succinct, or easier to understand. The fundamental difficulty of creative work is that we are often too close to it\\nto  see  it  objectively. Getting  feedback  is  really  about  borrowing  someone  else’s\\neyes to see what only a novice can see. It’s about stepping outside your subjective\\npoint of view and noticing what’s missing from what you’ve made. Once you understand how incredibly valuable feedback is, you start to crave as\\nmuch of it as you can find. You start looking for every opportunity to share your\\noutputs and gain some clarity on how other people are likely to receive it. These\\nmoments are so important that you will begin changing how you work in order to\\nget feedback as early and often as possible, because you know it is much easier to\\ngather  and  synthesize  the  thoughts  of  others  than  to  come  up  with  an  endless\\nseries  of  brilliant  thoughts  on  your  own. You  will  begin  to  see  yourself  as  the\\ncurator of the collective thinking of your network, rather than the sole originator\\nof ideas.

Everything Is a Remix\\n\\nThe CODE Method is based on an important aspect of creativity: that it is always\\na remix of existing parts. We all stand on the shoulders of our predecessors. No\\none creates anything out of a pure void. Kitbashing is a practice used in making small-scale models for action movies\\nlike Star Wars and Indiana Jones. To stay within time and budget, model makers\\nbuy prefabricated commercial kits and recombine them into new models for their\\nsets. Instead of fabricating new pieces from scratch, these premade parts—from\\nmodels of World War II flak cannons, US Navy battleships, fighter planes, T-34\\ntanks,  and  submarines—can  be  used  to  add  texture  and  fine  detail  to  special\\neffects  scenes  in  a  fraction  of  the  time  and  at  a  fraction  of  the  cost  it  would\\nnormally take. Adam Savage, host of the popular MythBusters television show and a skilled\\nmodel maker, noted that because these pieces are so versatile, “There were some\\nkits  to  which  you  would  return  repeatedly.” As  part  of  the  team  at  Industrial\\nLight  &  Magic,  the  studio  behind  many  special  effects  films,  he  relied  on  a\\nparticular kit that found its way into almost every model the team ever built. 7\\nDon’t take the work of others wholesale; borrow aspects or parts of their work.

Having a Second Brain where all\\nyour sources are clearly documented will make it much easier to track them down\\nand include those citations in the finished version. I remember the first time someone referred to what I do as “your work.” It\\ndawned  on  me  that  I  had  a  body  of  work  that  stood  on  its  own,  that  had  an\\nidentity  distinct  from  mine. This  is  a  turning  point  in  the  life  of  any  creative\\nprofessional—when  you  begin  to  think  of  “your  work”  as  something  separate\\nfrom yourself. Reframing your productivity in terms of Intermediate Packets is a major step\\ntoward this turning point. Instead of thinking of your job in terms of tasks, which\\nalways require you to be there, personally, doing everything yourself, you will start\\nto think in terms of assets and building blocks that you can assemble. As  the  potential  of  your  intellectual  assets  becomes  apparent,  you’ll  start  to\\nlook for any way to spend your time creating such assets and avoid one-off tasks\\nwhenever possible. You will start to seek out ways of acquiring or outsourcing the\\ncreation of these assets to others, instead of assuming you have to build them all\\nyourself. These changes will enable you to get things done at a pace that is far\\nbeyond what mere “productivity tips” can ever achieve. Even  if  you’re  not  writing  a  book  now,  or  creating  a  presentation  now,  or\\ndeveloping a new framework now, that doesn’t mean you never will. Every little\\ndigital artifact you create—the emails, the meeting notes, the project plans, the\\ntemplates, the examples—is part of the ongoing evolution of your body of work. They  are  like  the  neurons  in  an  intelligent  organism  that  is  growing,  evolving,\\nreaching for higher levels of consciousness with each new experience it has.

My  mother  is  a  singer  and  guitarist  from  Brazil,  and  some  of  my  earliest\\nmemories are of her soprano voice singing beautiful Portuguese lyrics to the tune\\nof a classical guitar. My father is a professional painter born in the Philippines. His\\ncanvases  bursting  with  colorful  fruits,  verdant  landscapes,  and  monumental\\nfigures covered every wall of our house, giving our home the ambience of an art\\ngallery. I’ve  never  recognized  the  common  stereotypes  of  the  “tortured  artist”—\\nmercurial, unpredictable, brooding, and unreliable. My father is one of the most\\norderly, responsible people I’ve ever met. Yet this regularity didn’t take away from\\nhis  fantastically  creative  artwork—it  contributed  to  it. I  saw  how  rigorous  his\\nroutines  had  to  be  to  allow  him  to  pursue  his  creative  calling  while  raising  a\\nfamily. He had a series of what he called his “strategies.” These were habits and tricks\\nthat he used to integrate creativity into every aspect of his life and quickly get into\\na creative state of mind whenever he had time to paint. During  sermons  at  our  local  church,  my  father  would  practice  sketching\\nbiblical  stories  in  a  small  paper  notebook  as  he  listened. Those  sketches  would\\noften become the starting point for larger, full-scale works measuring eight or ten\\nfeet high. While browsing the supermarket he would buy vegetables with unusual\\nshapes to take home and incorporate into his still lifes. Our groceries doubled as\\n\\nmodels  before  we  ate  them. Often  in  the  evening  when  we  were  watching  TV\\ntogether as a family, I’d catch him looking off to the side, at the wall of our living\\nroom, where he had hung a painting he was working on. He said he could have\\ninsights about what was missing by looking at it in a new light and out of the\\ncorner of his eye. My  father  planned  for  creativity. He  strategized  his  creativity. When  it  was\\ntime to make progress on a painting, he gave it his full focus, but that wasn’t the\\nonly  time  he  exercised  his  imagination. Much  of  the  rest  of  the  time  he  was\\ncollecting, sifting through, reflecting on, and recombining raw material from his\\ndaily  life  so  that  when  it  came  time  to  create,  he  had  more  than  enough  raw\\nmaterial to work with. This attention to organizing his creative influences fueled a\\nprolific body of work made up of thousands of paintings created over decades,\\nwhile still allowing him plenty of time to attend our soccer games, cook delicious\\nmeals, and travel widely as a family. What  I  learned  from  my  father  is  that  by  the  time  you  sit  down  to  make\\nprogress on something, all the work to gather and organize the source material\\nneeds to already be done. We can’t expect ourselves to instantly come up with\\nbrilliant ideas on demand. I learned that innovation and problem-solving depend\\non  a  routine  that  systematically  brings  interesting  ideas  to  the  surface  of  our\\nawareness.

This  standardized  routine  is  known  as  the creative  process,  and  it  operates\\naccording  to  timeless  principles  that  can  be  found  throughout  history. By\\nidentifying the principles that stand the test of time despite huge changes in the\\nunderlying technology, we can better understand the essential nature of creativity. The products of creativity are constantly changing and there is always a new\\n“hot” trend to run after. One year it’s Instagram photos, the next it’s Snapchat\\nstories, the next it’s TikTok videos, and so on forever. Even the long tradition of\\nthe novel has evolved for each era. But if you go one level deeper, to the process of creativity, it is a very different\\nstory. The creative process is ancient and unchanging. It was the same thousands\\nof years ago as it is today. There are lessons we can learn on that deeper level that\\ntranscend any particular medium and any particular set of tools. One of the most important patterns that underlies the creative process is called\\n“divergence and convergence.” II\\nDivergence and Convergence: A Creative Balancing Act\\nIf you look at the process of creating anything, it follows the same simple pattern,\\nalternating back and forth between divergence and convergence. A creative endeavor begins with an act of divergence. You open the space of\\npossibilities and consider as many options as possible. Like Taylor Swift’s notes,\\nTwyla  Tharp’s  box,  Francis  Ford  Coppola’s  prompt  book,  or  Octavia  Butler’s\\ncommonplace  notebooks,  you  begin  to  gather  different  kinds  of  outside\\n\\ninspiration,  expose  yourself  to  new  influences,  explore  new  paths,  and  talk  to\\nothers about what you’re thinking. The number of things you are looking at and\\nconsidering is increasing—you are diverging from your starting point. The activity of divergence is familiar to all of us: it is the classic whiteboard\\ncovered in sketches, the writer’s wastepaper basket filled with crumpled-up drafts,\\nand  the  photographer  with  hundreds  of photos  laid  out  across  the  floor. The\\npurpose  of  divergence  is  to  generate  new  ideas,  so  the  process  is  necessarily\\nspontaneous,  chaotic,  and  messy. You  can’t  fully  plan  or  organize  what  you’re\\ndoing in divergence mode, and you shouldn’t try. This is the time to wander. As powerful and necessary as divergence is, if all we ever do is diverge, then we\\nnever arrive anywhere. Like Francis Ford Coppola highlighting certain passages\\nand  crossing  out  others  in The  Godfather  novel,  at  some  point  you  must  start\\ndiscarding  possibilities  and  converging  toward  a  solution. Otherwise,  you  will\\nnever get the rewarding sense of completion that comes with hitting “send” or\\n“publish” and stepping back from the canvas or screen knowing you got the job\\ndone. Convergence forces us to eliminate options, make trade-offs, and decide what\\nis truly essential. It is about narrowing the range of possibilities so that you can\\nmake  forward  progress  and  end  up  with  a  final  result  you  are  proud  of. Convergence allows our work to take on a life of its own and become something\\nseparate from ourselves. The  model  of  divergence  and  convergence  is  so  fundamental  to  all  creative\\nwork, we can see it present in any creative field.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6e7200e8-f920-4ce5-8b54-4b4c68a81166":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6e7200e8-f920-4ce5-8b54-4b4c68a81166\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a9bca340-3b89-434d-8a78-78091a3d1d49\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"cf1c9936-d249-4cc3-b997-5fc1efeb4621\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Writers  diverge  by  collecting  raw  material  for  the  story  they  want  to  tell,\\nsketching out potential characters, and researching historical facts.

Engineers  diverge  by  researching  all  the  possible  solutions,  testing  the\\nboundaries  of  the  problem,  or  tinkering  with  new  tools. They  converge  by\\ndeciding  on  a  particular  approach,  designing  the  implementation  details,  and\\nbringing their blueprints to life. Designers  diverge  by  collecting  samples  and  patterns,  talking  to  users  to\\nunderstand  their  needs,  or  sketching  possible  solutions. They  converge  by\\n\\ndeciding on a problem to solve, building wireframes, or translating their designs\\ninto graphics files. Photographers  diverge  by  taking  photos  of  things  they  find  interesting,\\njuxtaposing  different  kinds  of  photos  together,  or  experimenting  with  new\\nlighting  or  framing  techniques. They  converge  by  choosing  the  shots  for  a\\ncollection, archiving unused images, and printing their favorites. If  we  overlay  the  four  steps  of  CODE  onto  the  model  of  divergence  and\\nconvergence, we arrive at a powerful template for the creative process in our time. The  first  two  steps  of  CODE,  Capture  and  Organize,  make  up  divergence. They are about gathering seeds of imagination carried on the wind and storing\\nthem in a secure place. This is where you research, explore, and add ideas. The\\nfinal two steps, Distill and Express, are about convergence. They help us shut the\\ndoor to new ideas and begin constructing something new out of the knowledge\\nbuilding blocks we’ve assembled. The Three Strategies I Use to Bring Creative Work Together\\nYour  Second  Brain  is  a  powerful  ally  in  overcoming  the  universal  challenge  of\\ncreative work—sitting down to make progress and having no idea where to start. Should you do more research, or start organizing the research you’ve already\\ndone? Should you widen your horizons, or narrow your focus? Should you start something new, or finish something you’ve already started? When you distinguish between the two modes of divergence and convergence,\\nyou  can  decide  each  time  you  begin  to  work  which  mode  you  want  to  be  in,\\n\\nwhich  gives  you  the  answers  to  the  questions  above. In  divergence  mode,  you\\nwant  to  open  up  your  horizons  and  explore  every  possible  option. Open  the\\nwindows and doors, click every link, jump from one source to another, and let\\nyour  curiosity  be  your  guide  for  what  to  do  next. If  you  decide  to  enter\\nconvergence  mode,  do  the  opposite:  close  the  door,  put  on  noise-canceling\\nheadphones, ignore every new input, and ferociously chase the sweet reward of\\ncompletion. Trust that you have enough ideas and enough sources, and it’s time\\nto turn inward and sprint toward your goal. Of the two stages of this process, convergence is where most people struggle. The more imaginative and curious you are, the more diverse your interests, and\\nthe higher your standards and commitment to perfection, the more difficult you\\nwill  likely  find  it  to  switch  from  divergence  mode  into  convergence  mode. It’s\\npainful to cut off options and choose one path over another. There is a kind of\\ncreative grief in watching an idea that you know is full of potential get axed from a\\nscript or a story. This is what makes creative work challenging. When you sit down to finish something—whether it’s an explanatory email, a\\nnew  product  design,  a  research  report,  or  a  fundraising  strategy—it  can  be  so\\ntempting  to  do  more  research.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"cf1c9936-d249-4cc3-b997-5fc1efeb4621":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"cf1c9936-d249-4cc3-b997-5fc1efeb4621\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"6e7200e8-f920-4ce5-8b54-4b4c68a81166\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"0ce572cc-e9a6-42ad-a799-34ae8527dadf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"It’s  so  easy  to  open  up  dozens  of  browser  tabs,\\norder  more  books,  or  go  off  in  completely  new  directions.

The Archipelago of Ideas: Give Yourself Stepping-Stones\\nThe Archipelago of Ideas technique is valuable any time you are starting a new\\npiece of work—whether it’s a how-to guide, a training workshop, a brief for a new\\nproject, or an essay you’re publishing on your blog. It gives you a way to plan your\\n\\nprogress  even  when  performing  tasks  that  are  inherently  unpredictable. The\\ntechnique  is  named  after  a  quote  by  Steven  Johnson,  the  author  of  a  series  of\\nfascinating books on creativity, innovation, and the history of ideas. 1\\n As Johnson\\nwrote:\\nInstead  of  confronting  a  terrifying  blank  page,  I’m  looking  at  a  document\\nfilled  with  quotes:  from  letters,  from  primary  sources,  from  scholarly  papers,\\nsometimes even my own notes. It’s a great technique for warding off the siren\\nsong  of  procrastination. Before  I  hit  on  this  approach,  I  used  to  lose  weeks\\nstalling  before  each  new  chapter,  because  it  was  just  a  big  empty  sea  of\\nnothingness. Now each chapter starts life as a kind of archipelago of inspiring\\nquotes, which makes it seem far less daunting. All I have to do is build bridges\\nbetween the islands. An archipelago is a chain of islands in the ocean, usually formed by volcanic\\nactivity  over  long  spans  of  time. The  Hawaiian  Islands,  for  example,  are  an\\narchipelago of eight major islands extending over about 1,500 miles of the Pacific\\nOcean. To  create  an  Archipelago  of Ideas,  you  divergently  gather  a  group  of  ideas,\\nsources,  or  points  that  will  form  the  backbone  of  your  essay,  presentation,  or\\ndeliverable. Once  you  have  a  critical  mass  of  ideas  to  work  with,  you  switch\\ndecisively into convergence mode and link them together in an order that makes\\nsense. Here’s an example of an Archipelago of Ideas note I created to help me write\\nan in-depth article on commonplace books:\\n\\nThe underlined links (which appear in green in my notes) are the sources I’m\\ndrawing on as research. Clicking a link will lead me not to the public web, where I\\ncan easily get distracted, but to another note within my Second Brain containing\\nmy full notes on that source. III\\n There I will find all the details I might need, as well\\nas a link back to the original work for my citations. Below each source, I’ve copied and pasted only the points I specifically want to\\nuse in this particular piece of writing. This Archipelago of Ideas includes external\\nsources  as  in  my  example  above,  but  also  notes  I’ve  taken  based  on  my  own\\nthoughts and experiences. This gives me the best of both worlds: I can focus only\\non the relevant points right in front of me, but all the other details I might need\\nare just a click away.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0ce572cc-e9a6-42ad-a799-34ae8527dadf":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0ce572cc-e9a6-42ad-a799-34ae8527dadf\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"cf1c9936-d249-4cc3-b997-5fc1efeb4621\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"e01d3f6e-5c2b-47ee-a6a2-bca7e075ae61\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"The bolds and highlights of Progressive Summarization help\\nme quickly determine which parts are most interesting and important at a glance. The Archipelago of Ideas technique is a contemporary reinvention of the age-\\nold practice of outlining—laying out the points you want to include up front, so\\nthat when it comes time to execute all you have to do is string them together. The\\nnote you see above is exactly what I will want in front of me when I sit down in\\nconvergence mode to finish the first draft of my article. Creating outlines digitally instead of on paper offers multiple major advantages:\\nA  digital  outline  is  far  more  malleable  and  flexible—you  can  add\\nbullet  points  and  cross  them  off,  rearrange  and  expand  on  them,  add\\nbolding  and  highlights,  and  edit  them  after  the  fact  as  your  thinking\\nchanges. The outline can link to more detailed content—instead  of  trying  to\\ncram every last point onto the same page, you can link to both your own\\nprivate  notes  and  public  resources  on  the  web,  which  helps  avoid\\noverloading the outline with too much detail. The outline is interactive and multimedia—you can add not only text,\\nbut images, GIFs, videos, attachments, diagrams, checkboxes, and more. The outline is searchable—even if it gets long, you have a powerful search\\nfeature to instantly call up any term you’re looking for. The outline can be accessed and edited from anywhere—unlike a piece\\nof paper in a notebook, your outline is instantaneously synced to every one\\nof your devices, and it can be viewed, edited, and added to from anywhere. An Archipelago of Ideas separates the two activities your brain has the most\\ndifficulty performing at the same time: choosing ideas (known as selection) and\\narranging them into a logical flow (known as sequencing). The reason it is so difficult to perform these activities simultaneously is they\\nrequire different modes: selection is divergent, requiring an open state of mind\\nthat is willing to consider any possibility. Sequencing is convergent, requiring a\\nmore closed state of mind focused only on the material you already have in front\\nof you. The goal of an archipelago is that instead of sitting down to a blank page or\\nscreen  and  stressing  out  about  where  to  begin,  you  start  with  a  series  of  small\\nstepping-stones  to  guide  your  efforts. First  you  select  the  points  and  ideas  you\\nwant to include in your outline, and then in a separate step, you rearrange and\\nsequence them into an order that flows logically. This makes both of those steps\\nfar more efficient, less taxing, and less vulnerable to interruption. Instead  of  starting  with  scarcity,  start  with  abundance—the  abundance  of\\ninteresting insights you’ve collected in your Second Brain. 2. The Hemingway Bridge: Use Yesterday’s Momentum\\nToday\\nErnest Hemingway was one of the most recognized and influential novelists of the\\ntwentieth century. He wrote in an economical, understated style that profoundly\\ninfluenced  a  generation  of  writers  and  led  to  his  winning  the  Nobel  Prize  in\\nLiterature in 1954. Besides  his  prolific  works,  Hemingway  was  known  for  a  particular  writing\\nstrategy, which I call the “Hemingway Bridge.” He would always end a writing\\nsession only when he knew what came next in the story.

IV\\nYou can think of a Hemingway Bridge as a bridge between the islands in your\\nArchipelago of Ideas. You may have the islands, but that is just the first step.

How do you create a Hemingway Bridge? Instead of burning through every\\nlast ounce of energy at the end of a work session, reserve the last few minutes to\\nwrite down some of the following kinds of things in your digital notes:\\n\\nWrite down ideas for next steps:  At  the  end  of  a  work  session,  write\\ndown what you think the next steps could be for the next one. Write down the current status: This could include your current biggest\\nchallenge, most important open question, or future roadblocks you expect. Write  down  any  details  you  have  in  mind  that  are  likely  to  be\\nforgotten once you step away:  Such  as  details  about  the  characters  in\\nyour  story,  the  pitfalls  of  the  event  you’re  planning,  or  the  subtle\\nconsiderations of the product you’re designing. Write out your intention for the next work session: Set an intention\\nfor what you plan on tackling next, the problem you intend to solve, or a\\ncertain milestone you want to reach. The  next  time  you  resume  this  endeavor,  whether  that’s  the  next  day  or\\nmonths later, you’ll have a rich set of jumping-off points and next steps waiting\\nfor  you. I  often  find  that  my  subconscious  mind  keeps  working  in  the\\nbackground to help me improve on those thoughts. When I return to the project,\\nI can combine the results of my past thinking with the power of a good night’s\\nsleep and put them together into a creative breakthrough. To take this strategy a step further, there is one more thing you can do as you\\nwrap  up  the  day’s  work:  send  off  your  draft  or  beta  or  proposal  for  feedback. Share  this  Intermediate  Packet  with  a  friend,  family  member,  colleague,  or\\ncollaborator; tell them that it’s still a work-in-process and ask them to send you\\ntheir thoughts on it. The next time you sit down to work on it again, you’ll have\\ntheir input and suggestions to add to the mix of material you’re working with. 3. Dial Down the Scope: Ship Something Small and Concrete\\nA third technique I recommend for convergence I call “Dial Down the Scope.” “Scope” is a term from project management that has been adopted by software\\ndevelopers, from whom I learned it while working in Silicon Valley. The scope\\nrefers to the full set of features a software program might include. Let’s say you’re designing a fitness app. You sketch out a beautiful vision: it\\nwill have workout tracking, calorie counts, a gym finder, progress charts, and even\\nconnect  you  with  others  via  a  social  network. It’s  going  to  be  amazing! It  will\\ntransform people’s lives! As with so many ambitious goals, once you get into the details it dawns on you\\njust how complex these features are to build. You have to design the user interface,\\nbut also build the backend system to make it work. You have to hire customer\\nsupport representatives and train them how to troubleshoot problems. You need a\\nwhole finance operation to keep track of payments and comply with regulations. Not  to  mention  all  the  responsibilities  of  managing  employees,  dealing  with\\ninvestors, and developing a long-term strategy. The  solution  that  software  teams  landed  on  to  deal  with  this  kind  of\\nballooning  complexity  is  to  “dial  down  the  scope.” Instead  of  postponing  the\\nrelease  of  the  app,  which  might  prove  disastrous  in  the  face  of  looming\\ncompetition and only delays the learning they need, the development team starts\\n“dialing down” features as the release date approaches. The social network gets\\npostponed to a future version. The progress charts lose their interactive features. The gym finder gets canceled completely.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"91f75da5-7436-482a-a0dd-0c6009f3cdf4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"91f75da5-7436-482a-a0dd-0c6009f3cdf4\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"e01d3f6e-5c2b-47ee-a6a2-bca7e075ae61\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"64c84104-0181-49d9-8446-c456a974f55d\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"The progress charts lose their interactive features. The gym finder gets canceled completely. The first parts to be dialed down are the\\nones that are most difficult or expensive to build, that have the most uncertainty\\nor risk, or that aren’t central to the purpose of the app. Like a hot-air balloon\\ntrying to take off, more and more features get thrown overboard to lighten the\\nload and get the product off the ground. Any features that don’t make it into this\\nversion can always be released as part of future software updates. How does this relate to our careers as knowledge workers? We also deliver complex pieces of work under strict deadlines. We also have\\nlimited  time,  money,  attention,  and  support—there  are  always  constraints  we\\nmust work within. When the full complexity of a project starts to reveal itself, most people choose\\nto delay it. This is true of projects at work, and even more true of side projects we\\ntake on in our spare time. We tell ourselves we just need more time, but the delay\\nends up creating more problems than it solves. We start to lose motivation as the\\ntime horizon stretches out longer and longer. Things get lost or go out of date. Collaborators move on, technology becomes obsolete and needs to be upgraded,\\n\\nand random life events never fail to interfere. Postponing our goals and desires to\\n“later” often ends up depriving us of the very experiences we need to grow. The problem isn’t a lack of time. It is that we forget that we have control over\\nthe scope of the project. We can “dial it down” to a more manageable size, and we\\nmust if we ever want to see it finished. Waiting until you have everything ready before getting started is like sitting in\\nyour car and waiting to leave your driveway until all the traffic lights across town\\nare green at the same time. You can’t wait until everything is perfect. There will\\nalways  be  something  missing,  or  something  else  you  think  you  need. Dialing\\nDown the Scope recognizes that not all the parts of a given project are equally\\nimportant. By dropping or reducing or postponing the least important parts, we\\ncan unblock ourselves and move forward even when time is scarce. Your Second Brain is a crucial part of this strategy, because you need a place to\\nsave the parts that get postponed or removed. You  might  cut  sentences  or  entire  pages  from  an  article  you’re  writing,  or\\ndelete scenes from a video you’re making, or drop parts of a speech when you’re\\ntrying  to  keep  within  your  allotted  time. This  is  a  completely  normal  and\\nnecessary part of any creative process. That doesn’t mean you have to throw away those parts. One of the best uses\\nfor a Second Brain is to collect and save the scraps on the cutting-room floor in\\ncase they can be used elsewhere. A slide cut from a presentation could become a\\nsocial media post. An observation cut from a report could become the basis for a\\nconference presentation. An agenda item cut from a meeting could become the\\nstarting  point  for  the  next  meeting. You  never  know  when  the  rejected  scraps\\nfrom  one  project  might  become  the  perfect  missing  piece  in  another. The\\npossibilities are endless. Knowing that nothing I write or create truly gets lost—only saved for later use\\n—gives  me  the  confidence  to  aggressively  cut  my  creative  works  down  to  size\\nwithout fearing that I’ve wasted effort or that I’ll lose the results of my thinking\\nforever. Knowing that I can always release a fix, update, or follow up on anything\\nI’ve  made  in  the  past  gives  me  the  courage  to  share  my  ideas  before  they’re\\nperfectly ready and before I have them all figured out. And sharing before I feel\\nready has completely altered the trajectory of my career. Whatever you are building, there is a smaller, simpler version of it that would\\ndeliver much of the value in a fraction of the time. Here are some examples:\\nIf you want to write a book, you could dial down the scope and write a\\nseries of online articles outlining your main ideas.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"64c84104-0181-49d9-8446-c456a974f55d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"64c84104-0181-49d9-8446-c456a974f55d\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"91f75da5-7436-482a-a0dd-0c6009f3cdf4\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ad9258a9-35ee-4944-9269-cb7bc2f33e58\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"If you don’t have time for\\nthat, you could dial it down even further and start with a social media post\\nexplaining the essence of your message.

How can you know which direction to take your thinking without feedback\\nfrom customers, colleagues, collaborators, or friends? And how can you collect\\nthat  feedback  without  showing  them  something  concrete? This  is  the  chicken-\\nand-egg problem of creativity: you don’t know what you should create, but you\\ncan’t discover what people want until you create something. Dialing Down the\\nScope  is  a  way  of  short-circuiting  that  paradox  and  testing  the  waters  with\\nsomething small and concrete, while still protecting the fragile and tentative edges\\nof your work. Divergence  and  convergence  are  not  a  linear  path,  but  a  loop:  once  you\\ncomplete one round of convergence, you can take what you’ve learned right back\\ninto a new cycle of divergence. Keep alternating back and forth, making iterations\\neach time until it’s something you can consider “done” or “complete” and share\\nmore widely. Divergence and Convergence in the Wild: Behind the Scenes\\nof a Home Project\\nLet me share an example of one of my own projects in which I used all three of\\nthese techniques: remodeling our garage into a home office. When  we  moved  into  our  home,  my  wife  and  I  soon  realized  we  needed  a\\nbetter workspace. We both work from home, and the tiny extra bedroom wasn’t\\ncutting it, especially once our son was born. We excitedly made plans to turn our\\ngarage into a home studio. The moment I created a dedicated project folder, I\\nknew it was on. I  started  by  creating  an  Archipelago  of  Ideas—an  outline  of  the  main\\nquestions, considerations, desired features, and constraints I thought our project\\nwould entail. Here is the outline I came up with after fifteen minutes:\\n\\nI  didn’t  know  up  front  what  the  main  headings  of  this  document  would\\ninclude, but as I wrote out my thoughts they soon emerged: Intro, Cost, Ideas,\\nPhases, Aesthetics, Zoom Setup, Equipment, and Open Questions. I did a few\\nsearches of my Second Brain for terms like “home office” and “home studio” and\\nfound  several  existing  notes  that  could  come  in  handy  as  well. For  example,  I\\nfound  the  notes  with  recommendations  from  a  friend  who  had  experience\\ndesigning studios, which I mentioned previously; photos of a beautifully designed\\ncafé in Mexico City that my wife and I loved visiting and wanted to mimic; and a\\nnote with best practices for hosting Zoom calls, such as finding the right lighting\\nand a background that isn’t too distracting. I added links to them at the bottom of\\nmy outline as well. Even with some existing material to work with, there were gaps in our plan. Over the next few weeks, whenever I had a free window of time, I collected and\\ncaptured tidbits of content to inform our home studio remodel. I saved photos\\nfrom  Pinterest  showing  examples  of  home  offices  that  I  thought  looked  neat;\\nnotes  from  a  conversation  with  a  musician  friend  who  taught  me  about\\nsoundproofing; and a list of local contractors a neighbor shared with me to reach\\nout to.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ad9258a9-35ee-4944-9269-cb7bc2f33e58":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ad9258a9-35ee-4944-9269-cb7bc2f33e58\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"64c84104-0181-49d9-8446-c456a974f55d\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"4e7586bc-1d48-4725-9139-91511250f7e3\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"I even went on a late-night spree watching dozens of videos of YouTubers\\ngiving  tours  of  their  studios,  taking  notes  on  the  small  details  of  how  they\\nconverted empty spaces into functional workspaces.

Whenever I could, I would highlight and distill\\nthe last few notes I’d captured and leave my future self a brief note about where I\\nleft  off. I  used  a  series  of  Hemingway  Bridges  to  string  together  many  such\\nwindows of time that otherwise wouldn’t have been of much productive use. Finally, as all these thoughts and ideas and wishes and dreams began to add up,\\nthe  project  became  quite  a  juggernaut. Before  I  knew  it,  our  ambitions  had\\nexpanded to knocking down walls, cutting through the roof for a skylight, laying\\ndown cable for superfast Internet, and redesigning the layout of the backyard to\\naccommodate it all. We had diverged too far and needed to rein it in a bit. This is where Dialing Down the Scope was essential: we identified the most\\noutlandish of our plans and decided to save those for a later stage. I moved those\\nideas  to  their  own  “someday/maybe”  section  of  my  outline  to  revisit  later. My\\nwife and I also added several constraints to the project, such as the budget we were\\nwilling to spend, and a deadline to have the remodel done by a certain date. These\\nconstraints helped us reduce the scope of the project to something reasonable and\\nmanageable. As  soon  as  we  did,  the  next  steps  of  finding  a  contractor  and\\nfinalizing the floorplan became crystal clear. Your Turn: Move Fast and Make Things\\nIf you’d like to give this approach to executing projects a try, now is the perfect\\ntime. Start by picking one project you want to move forward on. It could be one you\\nidentified in Chapter 5, when I asked you to make folders for each active project. It could alternatively be something you know you want to (or have to) get started\\non. The more uncertain, new, or challenging the project, the better. Make an outline with your goals, intentions, questions, and considerations for\\nthe project. Start by writing out anything already on your mind, and then peruse\\nyour PARA categories for related notes and Intermediate Packets. These could\\ninclude  points  or  takeaways  from  previously  created  notes,  inspiration  from\\nmodels or examples you want to borrow from, or templates you can use to follow\\nbest practices. Here are some useful questions to ask as you conduct your search:\\nIs  there  a  book  or  article  you  could  extract  some  excerpts  from  as\\ninspiration? Are there websites that might have resources you could build upon? Are there podcasts by experts you could subscribe to and listen to while\\ncommuting or doing household chores? Are  there  relevant  IPs  buried  in  other  projects  you’ve  worked  on  in  the\\npast? Some material you find will be very succinct and highly polished, while some\\nmight  be  quite  rough. It  doesn’t  matter—your  only  goal  is  to  get  all  the\\npotentially usable material in one place. Move all the notes and IPs you might\\nwant to use into a new project folder. Set a timer for a fixed period of time, such as fifteen or twenty minutes, and in\\none sitting see if you can complete a first pass on your project using only the notes\\nyou’ve  gathered  in  front  of  you. No searching online, no browsing social media,\\nand  no  opening  multiple  browser  tabs  that  you  swear  you’re  going  to  get  to\\neventually. Only work with what you already have. This first pass could be a plan,\\nan agenda, a proposal, a diagram, or some other format that turns your ideas into a\\ntangible artifact.

III. If your notes app syncs with your computer, this also means that you can disconnect from the Internet\\nand still make progress, since you have all your notes saved on your hard drive. IV. One way to think of this is to “end with the beginning in mind,” a clever rephrasing of author Stephen\\nCovey’s classic advice to “begin with the end in mind.” Chapter 9\\nThe Essential Habits of Digital Organizers\\nHabits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can\\nallocate your attention to other tasks...

At\\n\\neach step of CODE, there are habits that can help us be more organized so that\\nour creativity has space to arise. The Mise-en-Place Way to Sustainable Productivity\\nConsider  how  chefs  work  in  a  commercial  kitchen. They  have  incredibly  high\\ndemands on both the quality and quantity of their output. Every ingredient in\\nevery  dish  must  be  nearly  perfect—one  cold  side  or  undercooked  filet  and  the\\nwhole dish can be sent back, and the kitchen might have to produce hundreds of\\ndishes on a busy night. This  fundamental  tension—between  quality  and  quantity—is  a  tension  we\\nshare as knowledge workers. We also must produce work to an extremely high\\nstandard, and we must do it fast, continuously, all year long. We are like sprinters\\nwho are also trying to run a marathon. Chefs have a particular system for accomplishing this daunting feat. It’s called\\nmise  en  place,  a  culinary  philosophy  used  in  restaurants  around  the  world. Developed  in  France  starting  in  the  late  1800s,  mise  en  place  is  a  step-by-step\\nprocess for producing high-quality food efficiently. Chefs can never afford to stop\\nthe whole kitchen just so they can clean up. They learn to keep their workspace\\nclean and organized in the flow of the meals they are preparing. In the kitchen, this means small habits like always putting the mixing spoon in\\nthe same place so they know where to find it next time; immediately wiping a\\nknife clean after using it so it’s ready for the next cut; or laying out the ingredients\\nin the order they’ll be used so that they serve as placeholders. Chefs  use  mise  en  place—a  philosophy  and  mindset  embodied  in  a  set  of\\npractical techniques—as their “external brain.” 1\\n It gives them a way to externalize\\ntheir  thinking  into  their  environment  and  automate  the  repetitive  parts  of\\ncooking so they can focus completely on the creative parts. We have a lot to learn as knowledge workers from the system of mise en place. We likewise have to contend with a deluge of tasks, under uncertain conditions,\\nwith  tight  deadlines. We  also  receive  a  constant  stream  of  inputs  and  requests,\\nhave  too  little  time  to  process  them,  and  face  many  demands  requiring\\n\\nsimultaneous attention. For us as well, the only time we have available to maintain\\nour systems is during the execution of our regular work. There’s  no  time  that’s  magically  going  to  become  available  for  you  to  stop\\neverything and completely reorganize your digital world. It’s not likely that your\\nmanager is going to look kindly on you blocking off a whole day to “get caught\\nup.” Your  business  won’t  last  long  if  you  turn  customers  away  because  you’re\\n“maintaining your systems.” It’s difficult to find the time to put the world on\\nhold and catch your breath.

A system that adds some structure to the\\nconstantly changing flux of information that we interact with every day. In  this  chapter,  I  will  introduce  you  to  three  kinds  of  habits  that  can  be\\nintegrated into your routine to ensure your Second Brain remains functional and\\nrelevant. Each of these habits creates boundaries—of time, space, and intention—\\naround  the  states  of  mind  that  you  want  to  protect  and  promote  in  your  life. These  boundaries  tell  you  what  you  should  be  focusing  on,  and  just  as\\nimportantly, what you should ignore. The three habits most important to your\\nSecond Brain include:\\nProject  Checklists:  Ensure  you  start  and  finish  your  projects  in  a\\nconsistent way, making use of past work. Weekly and Monthly Reviews:  Periodically  review  your  work  and  life\\nand decide if you want to change anything. Noticing Habits: Notice small opportunities to edit, highlight, or move\\nnotes to make them more discoverable for your future self. You can think of these habits as the “maintenance schedule” of your Second\\nBrain. Just like you have a maintenance schedule for your car, which advises you\\nto regularly change the oil, rotate the tires, and change the air filters, your Second\\nBrain occasionally needs a tune-up to ensure it’s in good working order. Let’s explore these habits one at a time. The Project Checklist Habit: The Key to Starting Your\\nKnowledge Flywheel\\nAt the most basic level, knowledge work is about taking in information and then\\nturning it into results. All day, every day we are consuming and then producing. You don’t need special training to perform these activities, and you certainly don’t\\nneed a Second Brain. What most people are missing, however, is a feedback loop—a way to “recycle”\\nthe knowledge that was created as part of past efforts so it can be used in future\\nones as well. This is how investors think about money: they don’t get the profits\\nfrom one investment and immediately spend it all. They reinvest it back into other\\ninvestments, creating a flywheel so their money builds on itself over time. This  is  exactly  how  I  want  you  to  treat  your  attention—as  an  asset  that  gets\\ninvested and produces a return, which in turn can be reinvested back into other\\nventures. This is how you can ensure your knowledge grows and compounds over\\ntime  like  a  high-yield  asset. Like  investing  a  small  amount  in  the  stock  market\\nevery  month,  your  investments  of  attention  can  likewise  compound  as  your\\nknowledge grows and your ideas connect and build on each other. If  you  look  closely,  there  are  two  key  moments  in  this  process  of  recycling\\nknowledge. Two places where the paths diverge, and you have the chance to do\\nsomething different than you’ve done before. Those two moments are when a project starts, and when it finishes. For the\\nformer, I’ll introduce you to the Project Kickoff Checklist, and for the latter, the\\nProject Completion Checklist. Checklist #1: Project Kickoff\\nBefore  they  taxi  onto  the  runway  and  take  off,  airline  pilots  run  through  a\\n“preflight checklist” that tells them everything they need to check or do. It ensures\\nthey complete all the necessary steps without having to rely on their unreliable\\nbrains. The  way  most  people  launch  projects,  in  contrast,  can  be  described  as\\n“haphazardly.” They  might  look  through  their  existing  notes  and files  for  any\\ninformation that might be relevant, or they might not. They might talk to their\\ncolleagues about any lessons from past experience, or they might not. They might\\ncreate a plan to guide their progress, or they might not.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9ee7353a-5871-4c7c-8961-28bc6820b0d6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9ee7353a-5871-4c7c-8961-28bc6820b0d6\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"169fe34f-1427-4f6c-8939-9fb7b3bccb15\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"d8b6f3a5-ccda-4d0d-b95a-09266d521bb1\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"They might\\ncreate a plan to guide their progress, or they might not. The successful start of the\\nproject is more or less left to chance. In Chapter 5 we saw how work is becoming ever more project-centric. Every\\ngoal, collaboration, or assignment we take on can be defined as a project, which\\ngives it shape, focus, and a sense of direction. If we consider that these projects are\\nour biggest investments of attention, it’s worth adding a little bit of structure to\\nhow we start them. This is where the Project Kickoff Checklist comes in. Here’s my own checklist:\\n1. Capture my current thinking on the project. 2. Review folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes. 3. Search for related terms across all folders. 4. Move (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder. 5. Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project. 1. Capture my current thinking on the project. I often find that the moment\\na project begins to form in my mind, I start to have ideas and opinions about it. I\\nlike to start by creating a blank note and doing a brainstorm of any thoughts that\\ncome to mind. This first note is then placed inside a new project folder dedicated\\nto storing all the notes I’ll be creating related to it. This  step  can  and  should  be  messy:  I  pour  out  all  my  random  musings,\\npotential approaches, links to other ideas or topics, or reminders of people to talk\\nto. Here are some questions I use to prompt this initial brainstorm:\\nWhat do I already know about this project? What don’t I know that I need to find out? What is my goal or intention? Who can I talk to who might provide insights? What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas? Anything that comes to mind from these questions I write down in my starting\\nnote. I prefer using bullet points so the information is compact and can easily be\\nmoved around. 2. Review folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes. Second, I look\\nthrough any existing folders that might contain information relevant to the new\\nproject  I’m  starting,  including  related  templates,  outlines,  and  outtakes  from\\nprevious  projects. PARA  and  Progressive  Summarization  really  come  in  handy\\nhere: I already have a variety of folders, each containing a curated set of notes,\\nhighlighted and summarized so I can rapidly recall what they’re about. I choose a\\nhandful  of  folders  that  seem  most  relevant  to  what  I’m  starting,  including  in\\nprojects, areas, resources, and archives. Then I quickly scan any notes inside that\\nlook interesting, taking care to keep the momentum going so I don’t get bogged\\ndown anywhere. Now is not the time to go on tangents that will only distract me\\nfrom moving forward. 3. Search for related terms across all folders. The  third  step  is  to  perform\\nsearches  for  any  notes  I  might  have  missed. Sometimes  there  are  valuable  ideas\\nburied in unexpected places, which I may not find through browsing alone. This  is  where  the  Curator’s  Perspective  I  used  when  I  first  captured  the\\ncontent  really  pays  off—because  each  and  every  note  in  my  Second  Brain  was\\ndeliberately chosen, I am able to search through a collection of exclusively high-\\nquality notes free of fluff and filler. This is in stark contrast to searching the open\\nInternet, which is full of distracting ads, misleading headlines, superficial content,\\nand pointless controversy, all of which can throw me off track. I  run  a  series  of  searches  for  terms  related  to  the  new  project,  scanning  the\\nresults  and  quickly  jumping  into  any  note  that  seems  relevant. Progressive\\nSummarization  helps  here  too,  enabling  me  to  zoom  into  and  out  of  notes\\nwithout having to absorb their full contents. 4. Move (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder. Fourth, any notes found\\nin the previous two steps I move to the project folder, titled after the name of the\\nnew  project  I’m  starting.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"d8b6f3a5-ccda-4d0d-b95a-09266d521bb1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d8b6f3a5-ccda-4d0d-b95a-09266d521bb1\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"9ee7353a-5871-4c7c-8961-28bc6820b0d6\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"5ce421c9-43f2-459b-a055-8112e712aabb\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Alternatively,  depending  on  the  capabilities  of  your\\n\\nnotes app, you can also tag or link any relevant notes with the project, so you\\ndon’t have to move them from their original location. The important thing isn’t\\nwhere a note is located, but whether you can reference it quickly while staying\\nfocused on the project at hand. 5. Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project. Finally, it’s time\\nto pull together the material I’ve gathered and create an outline (an Archipelago of\\nIdeas) for the project. My goal is to end up not just with a loose collection of ideas. It is to formulate a logical progression of steps that make it clear what I should do\\nnext. The form this outline takes depends on the nature of the project. If it is a piece\\nof  writing  such  as  an  essay  or  report,  the  outline  might  be  the  main  points  or\\nheadings  I  want  to  include  in  the  final  piece. If  it  is  a  document  outlining  a\\ncollaborative  project  with  colleagues  or  outside  contractors,  the  outline  might\\ninclude the objectives we’re working toward and tentative responsibilities for each\\nperson. If it is a trip I’m planning to take, it might be a packing list and itinerary. The important thing to remember as you move through this checklist is that\\nyou are making a plan for how to tackle the project, not executing the project itself. You should think of this five-step checklist as a first pass, taking no more than\\ntwenty to thirty minutes. You’re only trying to get a sense of what kind of material\\nyou already have in your Second Brain. Once you do, you’ll have a much better\\nsense of how much time it will take, which knowledge or resources you’ll need\\naccess to, and what your challenges will likely be. I encourage you to use my kickoff checklist as a starting point and customize it\\nover time as you understand how it fits into your own context. Depending on\\nyour profession or industry, you might need more or less formality, more or less\\ntime  for  a  first  pass,  and  more  or  fewer  people  involved. Here  are  some  other\\noptions for actions you might want to include in your own version:\\nAnswer premortem\\nI\\n questions: What do you want to learn? What is the\\ngreatest  source  of  uncertainty  or  most  important  question  you  want  to\\nanswer? What is most likely to fail? Communicate with stakeholders: Explain to your manager, colleagues,\\nclients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc. , what the project is about\\nand why it matters. Define success criteria:  What  needs  to  happen  for  this  project  to  be\\nconsidered successful? What are the minimum results you need to achieve,\\nor the “stretch goals” you’re striving for? Have an official kickoff:  Schedule  check-in  calls,  make  a  budget  and\\ntimeline, and write out the goals and objectives to make sure everyone is\\ninformed, aligned, and clear on what is expected of them. I find that doing\\nan official kickoff is useful even if it’s a solo project! Checklist #2: Project Completion\\nNow let’s take a look at the Project Completion Checklist, the other side of the\\nequation. The completion of a project is a very special time in a knowledge worker’s life\\nbecause it’s one of the rare moments when something actually ends. Part of what\\nmakes  modern  work  so  challenging  is  that  nothing  ever  seems  to  finish. It’s\\nexhausting, isn’t it? Calls and meetings seem to stretch on forever, which means\\nwe rarely get to celebrate a clear-cut victory and start fresh. This is one of the best\\nreasons  to  keep  our  projects  small:  so  that  we  get  to  feel  a  fulfilling  sense  of\\ncompletion as often as possible. We don’t want to limit ourselves to merely celebrating the end of a project. We\\nwant  to  learn  from  the  experience  and  document  any  thinking  that  could  add\\nvalue in the future.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5ce421c9-43f2-459b-a055-8112e712aabb":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5ce421c9-43f2-459b-a055-8112e712aabb\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"d8b6f3a5-ccda-4d0d-b95a-09266d521bb1\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"aa70c0ef-e754-47e2-a165-6386a4b8ca37\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"This is where the Project Completion Checklist is essential. It’s a series of steps you can take to decide if there are any reusable knowledge\\nassets  worth  keeping,  before  archiving  the  rest. The  only  way  that  the  Kickoff\\nChecklist we just looked at will be feasible is if you’ve previously taken the time to\\nsave and preserve material from past projects. Here’s my checklist:\\n1. Mark project as complete in task manager or project management app. 2. Cross out the associated project goal and move to “Completed” section. 3. Review Intermediate Packets and move them to other folders. 4. Move project to archives across all platforms. 5. If project is becoming inactive: add a current status note to the project\\nfolder before archiving. 1. Mark project as complete in task manager or project management app. This is the first step is making sure the project is in fact finished. Often there are a\\nfew  lingering  tasks  needed  to  completely  wrap  it  up—such  as  getting  final\\napprovals, filing paperwork, or disseminating the project deliverables—which is\\nwhy I start by looking at my task manager. A task manager is a dedicated app for\\nkeeping track of pending actions, like a digital to-do list. II\\nIf all the tasks I find there are done, I can mark it as complete and move on to\\nthe following steps. 2. Cross out the associated project goal and move to “Completed” section. Each project I work on usually has a corresponding goal. I keep all my goals in a\\nsingle  digital  note,  sorted  from  short-term  goals  for  the  next  year  to  long-term\\ngoals for years to come. I like to take a moment and reflect on whether the goal I initially set for this\\nproject panned out. If I successfully achieved it, what factors led to that success? How  can  I  repeat  or  double  down  on  those  strengths? If  I  fell  short,  what\\nhappened? What can I learn or change to avoid making the same mistakes next\\ntime? The amount of time you spend thinking about these questions depends on\\nthe size of the project. A massive team endeavor might justify hours of in-depth\\nanalysis, while a small personal side project might deserve only a few minutes of\\nreflection. I  also  like  to  cross  out  the  goal  and  move  it  to  a  different  section  called\\n“Completed.” Any time I need some motivation, I can look through this list and\\nbe reminded of all the meaningful goals I’ve achieved in the past. It doesn’t matter\\nif the goal is big or small—keeping an inventory of your victories and successes is a\\nwonderful use for your Second Brain. 3. Review Intermediate Packets and move them to other folders. Third, I’ll\\nlook through the folder for the completed project to identify any Intermediate\\nPackets  I  created  that  could  be  repurposed  in  the  future. This  could  include  a\\nweb-page design to be used as a template for future sites, an agenda for a one-on-\\none  performance  review,  or  a  series  of  interview  questions  that  might  come  in\\nhandy for future hires. It takes a certain lens to see each of these documents and files not as disposable,\\nbut as tangible by-products of quality thinking. Much of our work gets repeated\\nover time with slight variations. If you can start your thinking where you left off\\nlast time, you’ll be far ahead compared to starting from zero every time. Any IPs I decide could be relevant to another project, I move to that project’s\\nfolder. The same goes for notes relevant to areas or resources. This is a forgiving\\ndecision, and it’s okay if you don’t catch every single one. The full contents of\\neverything you archive away will always show up in future searches, so you don’t\\nhave to worry that anything will be lost. 4. Move project to archives across all platforms. Fourth, it’s time to move the\\nproject folder to the archives in my notes app, as well as any other platforms I used\\nduring the project. For me, this usually includes my computer’s documents folder\\nand my cloud storage drive.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"aa70c0ef-e754-47e2-a165-6386a4b8ca37":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"aa70c0ef-e754-47e2-a165-6386a4b8ca37\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5ce421c9-43f2-459b-a055-8112e712aabb\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"078b8193-e110-4574-b2ff-39283ed54633\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"For me, this usually includes my computer’s documents folder\\nand my cloud storage drive. This move ensures that your list of active projects doesn’t get cluttered with\\nold, obsolete stuff from the past while also preserving every bit of material just in\\ncase it unexpectedly becomes relevant in the future. 5. If project is becoming inactive: add a current status note to the project\\nfolder before archiving. The  fifth  step  applies  only  if  the  project  is  getting\\ncanceled, postponed, or put on hold instead of completed. I still want to archive it\\nso it’s out of sight, but in this special case, there’s one final action I take. I add a new note to the project folder titled “Current status,” and jot down a\\nfew comments so I can pick it back up in the future. For example, in a few bullet\\npoints I might describe the last actions I took, details on why it was postponed or\\ncanceled, who was working on it and what role they played, and any lessons or\\n\\nbest practices learned. This Hemingway Bridge gives me the confidence to put the\\nproject on ice knowing I can bring it back to life anytime. I’ve been amazed that by being honest with myself about when a project has\\nstalled and taking these few minutes to download my current thinking on it, I can\\noften  pick  it  back  up  months  or  even  years  later  with  minimal  effort. It’s  very\\nempowering to realize you can put a project in “cold storage” and let go of the\\nmental toll of having to keep it in mind. It’s tremendously comforting to know\\nthat I don’t need to make constant progress on everything all the time. Here  are  some  other  items  you  can  include  on  your  Project  Completion\\nChecklist. I encourage you to personalize it for your own needs:\\nAnswer postmortem questions: What did you learn? What did you do\\nwell? What could you have done better? What can you improve for next\\ntime? Communicate  with  stakeholders:  Notify  your  manager,  colleagues,\\nclients,  customers,  shareholders,  contractors,  etc. ,  that  the  project  is\\ncomplete and what the outcomes were. Evaluate success criteria:  Were  the  objectives  of  the  project  achieved? Why or why not? What was the return on investment? Officially close out the project and celebrate:  Send  any  last  emails,\\ninvoices,  receipts,  feedback  forms,  or  documents,  and  celebrate  your\\naccomplishments with your team or collaborators so you receive the feeling\\nof fulfillment for all the effort you put in. The first pass on your Project Completion Checklist should be completed in\\neven less time than the Project Kickoff Checklist—no more than ten or fifteen\\nminutes to grab any stand-alone materials and insights. Since you don’t know for\\nsure that any of this material will ever be useful again, you should minimize how\\nmuch extra time and attention you invest in it. Put in just enough effort that your\\nfuture self will be able to decide if the material is relevant to their needs. If it is,\\nthen  they  can  decide  in  that  moment  whether  to  invest  the  effort  to  further\\norganize and distill it. The purpose of using project checklists isn’t to make the way you work rigid\\nand formulaic. It is to help you start and finish projects cleanly and decisively, so\\nyou  don’t  have  “orphaned”  commitments  that  linger  on  with  no  end  in  sight. Think of these checklists as scaffolding—a supporting structure that ensures what\\nyou’re  building  can  stand  on  its  own. Just  as  scaffolding  eventually  gets  taken\\ndown,  these  habits  will  get  absorbed  into  the  way  you  think  and  become\\ncompletely  second  nature. You  won’t  even  consider  starting  something  new\\nwithout querying your Second Brain to see if there is any material you can reuse. The Review Habit: Why You Should Batch Process Your\\nNotes (and How Often)\\nNext let’s talk about Weekly and Monthly Reviews.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"078b8193-e110-4574-b2ff-39283ed54633":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"078b8193-e110-4574-b2ff-39283ed54633\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"aa70c0ef-e754-47e2-a165-6386a4b8ca37\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"d0dc9062-4701-4661-bd5a-564f56b0e834\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"The  practice  of  conducting  a  “Weekly  Review”  was  pioneered  by  executive\\ncoach and author David Allen in his influential book Getting Things Done. III\\n He\\ndescribed a Weekly Review as a regular check-in, performed once a week, in which\\nyou intentionally reset and review your work and life. Allen recommends using a\\nWeekly Review to write down any new to-dos, review your active projects, and\\ndecide on priorities for the upcoming week. I suggest adding one more step: review the notes you’ve created over the past\\nweek, give them succinct titles that tell you what’s inside, and sort them into the\\nappropriate PARA folders. Most notes apps have an “inbox” of some kind where\\nnew notes collect until they’re ready to be reviewed. This “batch processing” takes\\nonly seconds per note, and you can complete it within a few minutes. Let’s dive into the details and see how Weekly and Monthly Reviews can help\\nyou maintain your Second Brain in a state of readiness for whatever arrives at your\\ndoorstep. A Weekly Review Template: Reset to Avoid Overwhelm\\nHere is my own Weekly Review Checklist, which I usually complete every three\\nto seven days depending on how busy a given week is. The point isn’t to follow a\\nrigid schedule, but to make it a habit to empty my inboxes and clear my digital\\n\\nworkspaces on a regular basis to keep them from getting overwhelmed. I keep this\\nchecklist on a digital sticky note on my computer, so I can easily refer to it. 1. Clear my email inbox. 2. Check my calendar. 3. Clear my computer desktop. 4. Clear my notes inbox. 5. Choose my tasks for the week. 1. Clear my email inbox. I  start  by  clearing  my  email  inbox  of  any  emails\\nlingering from the past week. I don’t usually have time to do this during the week\\nin the rush of my other priorities, but I’ve found that if I let messages accumulate\\nfrom one week to the next, it makes it hard to figure out what’s new and requires\\naction and what’s left over from the past. Any action items I find get saved in my task manager, and any notes I capture\\nget saved in my notes app. 2. Check my calendar. Next, I check my calendar. This is the landscape of my\\nweek, showing me the meetings and appointments I need to make room for. I\\ntypically look at the last couple of weeks in case there’s anything I need to follow\\nup  on,  and  the  upcoming  couple  of  weeks  in  case  there’s  anything  I  need  to\\nprepare for. Once again, anything I need to act on gets saved in my task manager, and any\\nnotes get captured in my notes app. 3. Clear my computer desktop. Next, I clear the files that have accumulated on\\nmy computer desktop. I’ve found that if I let them accumulate week after week,\\neventually my digital environment gets so cluttered that I can’t think straight. Any files potentially relevant to my projects, areas, or resources get moved to\\nthe appropriate PARA folders in my computer’s file system. 4. Clear my notes inbox. By the time I get to the fourth step, the inbox in my\\nnotes app is chock-full of interesting tidbits from the previous three steps—from\\nmy email, calendar, and computer desktop. Plus all the other notes I’ve collected\\nover  the  course  of  the  preceding  week,  which  usually  totals  between  five  and\\nfifteen new notes in an average week. At  this  point  I’ll  batch  process  them  all  at  once,  making  quick,  intuitive\\ndecisions about which of the PARA folders each note might be relevant to, and\\ncreating new folders as needed. There is no “correct” location for a given note, and\\nsearch is incredibly effective, so I put it in the first place that occurs to me. You’ll notice that this is the only step in my Weekly Review that is directly\\nrelated to my digital notes. It is a simple and practical process of going through my\\nnotes  inbox,  giving  each  note  an  informative  title,  and  moving  them  into  the\\nappropriate PARA folders.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"d0dc9062-4701-4661-bd5a-564f56b0e834":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d0dc9062-4701-4661-bd5a-564f56b0e834\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"078b8193-e110-4574-b2ff-39283ed54633\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"00a131e7-26df-4b20-90f6-a95aad912afe\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"I don’t highlight or summarize them.

This weekly sorting process serves as a light reminder\\nof  the  knowledge  I’ve  accumulated  over  the  past  week,  and  ensures  I  have  a\\nhealthy flow of new ideas and insights flowing into my Second Brain. 5. Choose my tasks for the week. There’s one final step in my Weekly Review. It’s  time  to  clear  the  inbox  in  my  task  manager  app. By  this  point,  there  are\\nlikewise a number of tasks that I’ve captured from my email, calendar, desktop,\\nand notes, and I take a few minutes to sort them into the appropriate projects and\\nareas. The final step of my Weekly Review is to select the tasks I’m committing to for\\nthe  upcoming  week. Because  I’ve  just  completed  a  sweep  of  my  entire  digital\\nworld and taken into account every piece of potentially relevant information, I\\ncan make this decision decisively and begin my week with total confidence that\\nI’m working on the right things. A Monthly Review Template: Reflect for Clarity and Control\\n\\nWhile  the  Weekly  Review  is  grounded  and  practical,  I  recommend  doing  a\\nMonthly Review that is a bit more reflective and holistic. It’s a chance to evaluate\\nthe big picture and consider more fundamental changes to your goals, priorities,\\nand systems that you might not have the chance to think about in the busyness of\\nthe day-to-day. Here’s mine:\\n1. Review and update my goals. 2. Review and update my project list. 3. Review my areas of responsibility. 4. Review someday/maybe tasks. 5. Reprioritize tasks. 1. Review and update my goals. I start by reviewing my goals for the quarter\\nand the year. I ask myself questions like “What successes or accomplishments did I\\nhave?” and “What went unexpectedly and what can I learn from it?” I’ll take some\\ntime to cross off any completed goals, add any new ones that have emerged, or\\nchange the scope of goals that no longer make sense. 2. Review and update my project list. Next, I’ll review and update my project\\nlist. This includes archiving any completed or canceled projects, adding any new\\nones, or updating active projects to reflect how they’ve changed. I will also update\\nthe folders in my notes app to reflect these changes. It’s  important  that  the  project  list  remains  a  current,  timely,  and  accurate\\nreflection  of  your  real-life  goals  and  priorities. Especially  since  projects  are  the\\ncentral organizing principle of your Second Brain. When you have a project folder\\nready and waiting, your mind is primed to notice and capture the best ideas to\\nmove it forward. 3. Review my areas of responsibility. Now it’s time to do the same for my areas\\nof responsibility. I’ll think about the major areas of my life, such as my health,\\nfinances,  relationships,  and  home  life,  and  decide  if  there’s  anything  I  want  to\\n\\nchange or take action on. This reflection often generates new action items (which\\ngo into my task manager) and new notes (which get captured in my notes app). Area notebooks often contain notes that become the seeds of future projects. For example, I used an area folder called “Home” to collect photos for the home\\nstudio remodel I mentioned previously. Even before it was an active project, that\\nbroader area gave me a place to collect ideas and inspiration so it was ready and\\nwaiting the moment we decided to get started. 4. Review someday/maybe tasks. “Someday/maybe”  is  a  special  category  for\\nthings I’d like to get to someday, but not in the near future.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"00a131e7-26df-4b20-90f6-a95aad912afe":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"00a131e7-26df-4b20-90f6-a95aad912afe\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"d0dc9062-4701-4661-bd5a-564f56b0e834\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"f419c157-0b2d-475d-b79e-d5bf04139ee0\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Things like “Learn\\nMandarin” and “Plant an orchard.” These kinds of future dreams are important\\nto keep track of, but you don’t want them cluttering your priorities today. I’ll take\\na few minutes to go through my “someday/maybe” tasks just in case any of them\\nhave  become actionable. For  example,  when  my  wife  and  I  settled  down  and\\nbecame  homeowners,  our  dream  of  getting  a  dog,  which  was  impossible  while\\nmoving  from  one  apartment  to  another,  suddenly  came  within  reach. I  had\\nalready  saved  a  few  notes  on  the  kinds  of  dogs  we  should  consider  (athletic,\\nhypoallergenic,  good  with  kids,  etc.) ,  and  this  step  in  my  Monthly  Review\\nreminded me to bring them to the surface. 5. Reprioritize tasks. Finally, once I’ve completed all the previous steps and have\\na holistic picture of my goals and projects in mind, it’s time to reprioritize my\\ntasks. I’m  often  surprised  just  how  much  can  change  in  a  month. To-dos  that\\nseemed critical last month might become irrelevant this month, and vice versa. The Noticing Habits: Using Your Second Brain to Engineer\\nLuck\\nThere’s a third category of habits that will come in handy as you start putting\\nyour  Second  Brain  into  action  in  the  real  world. It  is  in  some  ways  the  most\\nimportant category, but also the least predictable. I  call  them  “noticing”  habits—taking  advantage  of  small  opportunities  you\\nnotice  to  capture  something  you  might  otherwise  skip  over  or  to  make  a  note\\n\\nmore actionable or discoverable. Here are some examples:\\nNoticing that an idea you have in mind could potentially be valuable and\\ncapturing it instead of thinking, “Oh, it’s nothing.” Noticing when an idea you’re reading about resonates with you and taking\\nthose extra few seconds to highlight it. Noticing that a note could use a better title—and changing it so it’s easier\\nfor your future self to find it. Noticing you could move or link a note to another project or area where it\\nwill be more useful. Noticing opportunities to combine two or more Intermediate Packets into\\na new, larger work so you don’t have to start it from scratch. Noticing a chance to merge similar content from different notes into the\\nsame note so it’s not spread around too many places. Noticing when an IP that you already have could help someone else solve a\\nproblem, and sharing it with them, even if it’s not perfect. The nice thing about notes, unlike to-dos, is that they aren’t urgent. If one\\nimportant to-do gets overlooked, the results could be catastrophic. Notes, on the\\nother hand, can easily be put on hold any time you get busy, without any negative\\nimpact. If you have the time to organize your notes each week, that’s great. If you\\ndon’t, it’s no problem. I often will wait weeks or even a month or longer before I\\nfind the time to clear my notes inbox. They remain ready and waiting there for as\\nlong as I need. The most common misconception about organizing I see when I’m working\\nwith clients is the belief that organizing requires a heavy lift. They seem to believe\\nthat if they could just block off their calendar and get a few days free of pressing\\ncommitments, then they’d finally be able to curb the clutter and clear their head. Even on the rare occasions I’ve seen people somehow manage to clear such a\\nbig block of time, it never seems to go very well. They tend to get bogged down in\\n\\nminutiae  and  barely  make  a  dent  in  the  mountain  of  accumulated  stuff  they\\nwanted to tackle. Then they’re saddled with a feeling of guilt that they weren’t\\nable to make progress even with so much time at their disposal.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f419c157-0b2d-475d-b79e-d5bf04139ee0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f419c157-0b2d-475d-b79e-d5bf04139ee0\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"00a131e7-26df-4b20-90f6-a95aad912afe\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"c252678c-8e94-436c-8b5c-540f9faccd44\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"It’s not natural for\\nhumans  to  completely  reorganize  their  entire  world  all  at  once. There  are  too\\nmany layers, too many facets of a human life, to perfectly square every little detail. It’s crucial to stay organized, but it needs to be done a little at a time in the flow\\nof our normal lives. It needs to be done in the in-between moments of moving\\nyour projects forward as you notice small opportunities for improvement. Here are more specific examples of what those opportunities might look like:\\nYou decide to visit Costa Rica on your next vacation, so you move a note\\nwith  useful  Spanish  phrases  from  your  “Languages”  resource  folder  to  a\\n“Costa Rica” project folder to aid in your trip. Your director of engineering leaves for another job and you need to hire a\\nnew  one,  so  you  move  the  folder  you  created  last  time  for  “Engineering\\nhire” from archives to projects to guide your search. You schedule the next in a series of workshops you are facilitating and move\\na PDF with workshop exercises from an area folder called “Workshops” to a\\nnew project folder for the specific workshop you’re planning. You notice that you need to buy a new computer because your current one\\nis  getting  too  slow,  so  you  move  some  articles  you’ve  saved  from  the\\n“Computer research” resource folder to a new project folder called “Buy a\\nnew computer.” All these actions take mere moments, and are made in response to changes in\\nyour priorities and goals. We should avoid doing a lot of heavy lifting up front,\\nnot only because it takes up precious time and energy, but because it locks us into\\na course of action that might not end up being right. When you make your digital notes a working environment, not just a storage\\nenvironment, you end up spending a lot more time there. When you spend more\\ntime  there,  you’ll  inevitably  notice  many  more  small  opportunities  for  change\\nthan you expect. Over time, this will gradually produce an environment far more\\n\\nsuited to your real needs than anything you could have planned up front. Just like\\nprofessional  chefs  keep  their  environment  organized  with  small  nudges  and\\nadjustments, you can use noticing habits to “organize as you go.” Your Turn: A Perfect System You Don’t Use Isn’t Perfect\\nEach  of  the  three  kinds  of  habits  I’ve  introduced  you  to—Project  Kickoff  and\\nCompletion Checklists, Weekly and Monthly Reviews, and Noticing Habits—are\\nall meant to be performed quickly in the in-between spaces of your day. They are designed to build on activities you are probably already doing in some\\nform, adding perhaps a little bit more structure. These shouldn’t be massive feats,\\nrequiring you to set aside huge chunks of time in total Zen-like isolation. That’s\\nnot realistic, and if you wait until those perfect conditions arrive, you’ll never take\\neven the first step. The  checklists  I’ve  provided  are  a  starting  point  to  help  you  add  some\\npredictability  in  an  environment  that  is  often  chaotic  and  unpredictable. They\\nprovide a regular cadence of actions for taking in, processing, and making use of\\ndigital  information,  without  requiring  you  to  stop  everything  and  reorganize\\neverything all at once. I  want  to  remind  you  that  the  maintenance  of  your  Second  Brain  is  very\\nforgiving. Unlike a car engine, nothing will explode, break down, or burst into\\nflames if you let things slide for days, weeks, or even months. The entire point of\\nbuilding  a  Second  Brain  and  pouring  your  thoughts  into  it  is  to  make  those\\nthoughts less vulnerable to the passage of time. They will be ready to pick up right\\nwhere you left off when you have more time or motivation.

The truth is, any system that must be perfect to be reliable is deeply flawed. A\\nperfect system you don’t use because it’s too complicated and error prone isn’t a\\nperfect system—it’s a fragile system that will fall apart as soon as you turn your\\nattention elsewhere. We  have  to  remember  that  we  are  not  building  an  encyclopedia  of\\nimmaculately organized knowledge. We are building a working system.

For  that  reason,  you  should  prefer  a  system  that  is  imperfect,  but  that\\ncontinues to be useful in the real conditions of your life. I.

Although  outside  the  scope  of  this  book,  I’ve  included  my  recommendations  for  task  managers  on\\nmultiple operating systems in the Second Brain Resource Guide at Buildingasecondbrain. com/resources. III. The  book Getting  Things  Done,  known  as  GTD,  is  a  helpful  counterpart  to  personal  knowledge\\nmanagement,  applying  the  same  lens  of  “getting  things  off  your  mind”  that  we  are  using  for  notes  to\\n“actionable” information such as to-dos. Chapter 10\\nThe Path of Self-Expression\\nAn idea wants to be shared. And, in the sharing, it becomes more\\ncomplex, more interesting, and more likely to work for more people. —adrienne maree brown, writer and activist\\nFor  most  of  history,  humanity’s  challenge  was  how  to  acquire  scarce\\ninformation. There was hardly any good information to be found anywhere. It\\nwas  locked  up  in  difficult-to-reproduce  manuscripts  or  stuck  in  the  heads  of\\nscholars. Access to information was limited, but that wasn’t a problem for most\\npeople. Their lives and livelihoods didn’t require much information. Their main\\ncontribution was their physical labor, not their ideas. That has all changed in just the last few decades. Historically, in the blink of an\\neye. Suddenly,  we  are  all  plugged  into  an  infinite  stream  of  data,  updated\\ncontinuously  and  delivered  at  light  speed  via  a  network  of  intelligent  devices\\nembedded in every corner of our lives. Not only that, but the very nature of labor has changed. Value has shifted from\\nthe output of our muscles to the output of our brains. Our knowledge is now our\\nmost important asset and the ability to deploy our attention our most valuable\\nskill. The tools of our trade have become abstract and immaterial: the building\\nblocks of ideas, insights, facts, frameworks, and mental models. Now  our  challenge  isn’t  to  acquire  more  information;  as  we  saw  in  the\\nexploration  of  divergence  and  convergence,  it  is  to  find  ways  to  close  off  the\\nstream  so  we  can  get  something  done. Any  change  in  how  we  interact  with\\ninformation first requires a change in how we think. In this chapter we’ll explore\\nwhat it looks like and feels like to make that shift.

Whatever you are looking for, all these paths eventually lead to the same place,\\nif  you  are  willing  to  follow:  a  journey  of  personal  growth. There  is  no  divide\\nbetween our inner selves and our digital lives: the beliefs and attitudes that shape\\nour thinking in one context inevitably show up in other contexts as well. Underlying  our  struggles  and  challenges  with  productivity,  creativity,  and\\nperformance is our fundamental relationship to the information in our lives. That\\nrelationship  was  forged  during  your  upbringing  as  you  encountered  new\\nexperiences, and was influenced by your personality, learning style, relationships,\\nand your genes. You learned to react in a certain way when faced with new ideas. You adopted a default “blueprint” for how you treated incoming information—\\nwith anticipation, fear, excitement, self-doubt, or some complex mix of feelings\\nthat is unique to you. That default attitude to information colors every aspect of your life. It is the\\nlens through which you studied for classes and took tests in school. It set the stage\\nfor the kinds of jobs and careers you pursued. At this very moment, as you read\\nthese words, that default attitude is working in the background. It is telling you\\nwhat to think about what you’re reading—how to interpret it, how to feel about\\nit, and how it applies to you. Our  attitude  toward  information  profoundly  shapes  how  we  see  and\\nunderstand the world and our place in it. Our success in the workforce depends\\non our ability to make use of information more effectively and to think better,\\nsmarter,  faster. As  society  gets  ever  more  complex,  this  emphasis  on  personal\\nintelligence is only increasing. The quality of our thinking has become one of the\\n\\ncentral defining features of our identity, our reputation, and our quality of life. We are constantly advised that we need to know more to be able to achieve our\\ngoals and dreams. What would you say if I told you that isn’t true? The Fear Our Minds Can’t Do Enough\\nWhen it comes to accomplishing our goals, it’s not that innate intelligence isn’t\\nvaluable. I’m saying that the greater the burden you place on your biological brain\\nto  give  you  everything  you  want  and  need,  the  more  it  will  struggle  under  the\\nweight of it all. You’ll feel more stressed, anxious, like there are way too many balls\\nin the air. The more time your brain spends striving to achieve and overcome and\\nsolve problems, the less time you have left over for imagining, creating, and simply\\nenjoying the life you’re living. The brain can solve problems, but that isn’t its sole\\npurpose. Your mind was meant for much more. It is this fundamental attitude toward information that will start to change as\\nyou integrate your Second Brain into your life. You will begin to see connections\\nyou  didn’t  know  you  could  make. Ideas  about  business,  psychology,  and\\ntechnology  will  connect  and  spawn  new  revelations  you’ve  never  consciously\\nconsidered. Lessons from art, philosophy, and history will intermingle to give you\\nepiphanies about how the world works. You will naturally start to combine these\\nideas to form new perspectives, new theories, and new strategies. You will be filled\\nwith a sense of awe at the elegance of the system you’ve created, and how it works\\nin almost mysterious ways to bring to your attention the information you need.

Once you start seeing\\neven your biggest ambitions in terms of the smaller chunks of information they\\nare made up of, you’ll begin to realize that any experience or passing insight can be\\nvaluable. Your fears, doubts, mistakes, missteps, failures, and self-criticism—it’s all\\njust information to be taken in, processed, and made sense of. All of it is part of a\\nlarger, ever-evolving whole. A  participant  in  one  of  my  courses  named  Amelia  recently  told  me  that\\nstarting to build her Second Brain had caused her to make a 180-degree change in\\nher relationship to the Internet. She had seen it as “sensationalistic and offensive”\\nand, as a result, hadn’t wanted to engage with the online world at all. Once she\\nhad  a  place  where  she  could  curate  the  best  of  the  Internet  while  ignoring\\neverything that didn’t serve her, she told me she began to see it in a completely\\nnew light. Amelia is a skilled leadership coach who runs a clinic teaching leaders\\nhow  to  manage  their  nervous  systems  to  improve  their  well-being  and\\neffectiveness. Imagine how many more people she can reach with her expertise\\nnow that she sees the Internet as a source of wisdom and connection, not just\\nnoise. How does such a dramatic change happen? Amelia didn’t necessarily learn a\\nnew fact that she didn’t know before. She took on a new perspective. She chose to\\nlook  at  the  world  through  a  different  lens—the  lens  of  appreciation  and\\nabundance. We can’t always control what happens to us, but we can choose the\\nlens  we  look  through. This  is  the  basic  choice  we  have  in  creating  our  own\\nexperience—which aspects to nourish or starve, using only the magnifying power\\nof our attention. As you build a Second Brain, your biological brain will inevitably change. It\\nwill start to adapt to the presence of this new technological appendage, treating it\\nas an extension of itself. Your mind will become calmer, knowing that every idea is\\nbeing tracked. It will become more focused, knowing it can put thoughts on hold\\nand access them later. I often hear that people start to feel a tremendous sense of\\nconviction—for their goals, their dreams, and the things they want to change or\\ninfluence in the world—because they know they have a powerful system behind\\nthem amplifying every move they make. Giving Your First Brain a New Job\\nInstead of trying to optimize your mind so that it can manage every tiny detail of\\nyour life, it’s time to fire your biological brain from that job and give it a new one:\\nas  the  CEO  of  your  life,  orchestrating  and  managing  the  process  of  turning\\n\\ninformation into results. We’re asking your biological brain to hand over the job\\nof remembering to an external system, and by doing so, freeing it to absorb and\\nintegrate new knowledge in more creative ways. Your Second Brain is always on, has perfect memory, and can scale to any size. The  more  you  outsource  and  delegate  the  jobs  of  capturing,  organizing,  and\\ndistilling to technology, the more time and energy you’ll have available for the self-\\nexpression that only you can do. Once your biology is no longer the bottleneck on your potential, you’ll be free\\nto expand the flow of information as much as you want without drowning in it. You’ll be more balanced and peaceful, knowing you can step away from that flow\\nat any time because it’s all being stored safely outside your head. You will be more\\ntrusting,  because  you’ve  learned  to  trust  a  system  outside  yourself. It  will  be\\nincredibly humbling and reassuring, in fact, that you are not solely responsible for\\nall the remembering that needs to happen in your life. You will be more open-\\nminded, willing to consider more unorthodox, more challenging, more unfinished\\nideas, because you have a plentiful supply of alternatives to choose from.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b3b53b41-c64d-410c-9cff-52240debfdd2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b3b53b41-c64d-410c-9cff-52240debfdd2\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"54891ada-1b73-416a-844f-555e2505fc37\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"dd826524-a402-4ffe-a428-b5727d176d6b\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"You’ll\\nwant to expose yourself to more diverse perspectives, from more people, without\\nnecessarily committing to any single one.

The\\nvoice of fear creeps up in the back of your mind: “Will there be anything left for\\nme to do?” “Will I still be valued and needed?” We are taught that it’s better to\\nhave a secure role than risk being replaced.

Emptying ourselves of\\nour  jumble  of  thoughts  requires  courage,  because  without  our  thoughts  as\\ndistractions, we are left to sit with uncomfortable questions about our future and\\nour purpose. That is why building a Second Brain is a journey of personal growth. As your\\ninformation  environment  changes,  the  way  your mind  operates  starts  to  be\\ntransformed.

We’ve been conditioned to view\\ninformation  through  a  consumerist  lens:  that  more  is  better,  without  limit. Through the lens of scarcity, we constantly crave more, more, more information,\\na response to the fear of not having enough. 1\\n We’ve been taught that information\\nmust be jealously guarded, because someone could use it against us or steal our\\nideas. That our value and self-worth come from what we know and can recite on\\ncommand. As we saw in the chapter on Capturing, the inclination to amass information\\ncan become an end in itself. It is all too easy to default to collecting more and\\nmore content without regard to whether it is useful or beneficial to us. This is\\nindiscriminate  consumption  of  information,  treating  every  meme  and  random\\npost on social media as if it was just as important as the most profound piece of\\nwisdom. It is driven by fear—the fear of missing out on some crucial fact, idea, or\\nstory that everyone is talking about. The paradox of hoarding is that no matter\\nhow much we collect and accumulate, it’s never enough. The lens of scarcity also\\ntells  us  that  the  information  we  already  have  must  not  be  very  valuable,\\ncompelling us to keep searching externally for what’s missing inside. The opposite of a Scarcity Mindset is an Abundance Mindset. This is a way of\\nlooking at the world as full of valuable and helpful things—ideas, insights, tools,\\ncollaborations,  opportunities. An  Abundance  Mindset  tells  us  that  there  is  an\\n\\nendless  amount  of  incredibly  powerful  knowledge  everywhere  we  look—in  the\\ncontent we consume, in our social network, in our bodies and intuitions, and in\\nour own minds. It also tells us that we don’t need to consume or understand all of\\nit, or even much of it. All we need is a few seeds of wisdom, and the seeds we most\\nneed tend to continually find us again and again. You don’t need to go out and\\nhunt down insights.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"dd826524-a402-4ffe-a428-b5727d176d6b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"dd826524-a402-4ffe-a428-b5727d176d6b\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"b3b53b41-c64d-410c-9cff-52240debfdd2\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"e8560c36-2aaa-42ed-a41c-cf7d1b7a954c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"You don’t need to go out and\\nhunt down insights. All you have to do is listen to what life is repeatedly trying to\\ntell you. Life tends to surface exactly what we need to know, whether we like it or\\nnot. Like a compassionate but unyielding teacher, reality doesn’t bend or cave to\\nour will. It patiently teaches us in what ways our thinking is not accurate, and\\nthose lessons tend to show up across our lives again and again. Making the shift to a mindset of abundance is about letting go of the things we\\nthought we needed to survive but that no longer serve us. It means giving up low-\\nvalue work that gives us a false sense of security but that doesn’t call forth our\\nhighest selves. It’s about letting go of low-value information that seems important,\\nbut that doesn’t make us better people. It’s about putting down the protective\\nshield  of  fear  that  tells  us  we  need  to  protect  ourselves  from  the  opinions  of\\nothers, because that same shield is keeping us from receiving the gifts they want to\\ngive us. The Shift from Obligation to Service\\nThere is a second shift that occurs when you begin to use your Second Brain not\\nonly for remembering, but for connecting and creating. You will transition from\\ndoing things primarily out of obligation or pressure to doing things from a spirit\\nof service. I believe most people have a natural desire within them to serve others. They\\nwant  to  teach,  to  mentor,  to  help,  to  contribute. The  desire  to  give  back  is  a\\nfundamental part of what makes us human. I also notice that many people put that desire on hold. They are waiting for a\\nfuture  time  when  they  will  have  “enough”  time,  bandwidth,  expertise,  or\\nresources. That day seems to get continuously postponed as they get new jobs,\\nstart new careers, have kids, and simply try to keep up with the demands of life. You are under no obligation to help others. Sometimes it’s all you can do to\\ntake  care  of  yourself. Still,  I’ve  noticed  time  and  again  a  phenomenon  that\\nhappens as people collect more and more knowledge in their Second Brain. That\\ninner  desire  to  serve  slowly  comes  to  the  surface. Faced  with  the  evidence  of\\neverything they already know, suddenly there’s no longer any reason to wait. The  purpose  of  knowledge  is  to  be  shared. What’s  the  point  of  knowing\\nsomething  if  it  doesn’t  positively  impact  anyone,  not  even  yourself? Learning\\nshouldn’t be about hoarding stockpiles of knowledge like gold coins. Knowledge\\nis the only resource that gets better and more valuable the more it multiplies. If I\\nshare  a  new  way  of  thinking  about  your  health,  or  finances,  or  business,  or\\nspirituality, that knowledge isn’t less valuable to me. It’s more valuable! Now we\\ncan  speak  the  same  language,  coordinate  our  efforts,  and  share  our  progress  in\\napplying it. Knowledge becomes more powerful as it spreads. There  are  problems  in  the  world  that  you  are  uniquely  equipped  to  solve. Problems in society like poverty, injustice, and crime. Problems in the economy\\nlike  inequality,  educational  deficits,  and  workers’  rights. Problems  in\\norganizations like retention, culture, and growth. Problems in the lives of people\\naround you that your product or service or expertise could solve, helping them\\ncommunicate, learn, or work more effectively. As Ryder Carroll says in The Bullet\\nJournal Method, “Your singular perspective may patch some small hole in the vast\\ntattered fabric of humanity.” There are people who will be reached only if they are reached by you. People\\nwho have no other source for the kind of guidance you can provide. People who\\ndon’t know where to look for solutions to problems they might not even know\\nthey have. You can be that person for them.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e8560c36-2aaa-42ed-a41c-cf7d1b7a954c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e8560c36-2aaa-42ed-a41c-cf7d1b7a954c\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"dd826524-a402-4ffe-a428-b5727d176d6b\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"1718453e-413c-42a5-a905-8eff7680ad75\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"You can be that person for them.

You have\\neverything you need to give back and be a force for good in the world. It all starts\\nwith knowledge, and you have at your disposal an embarrassment of riches. The Shift from Consuming to Creating\\nThe practice of building a Second Brain is more than the sum of capturing facts,\\ntheories,  and  the  opinions  of  others. At  its  core,  it  is  about  cultivating  self-\\nawareness and self-knowledge. When you encounter an idea that resonates with\\nyou, it is because that idea reflects back to you something that is already within\\nyou. Every external idea is like a mirror, surfacing within us the truths and the\\nstories that want to be told. In a 1966 book,\\nI\\n the British-Hungarian philosopher Michael Polanyi made an\\nobservation  that  has  since  become  known  as  “Polanyi’s  Paradox.” It  can  be\\nsummarized as “We know more than we can say.” Polanyi observed that there are many tasks we can easily perform as humans\\nthat we can’t fully explain. For example, driving a car or recognizing a face. We\\ncan try to describe how we do these things, but our explanations always fall far\\nshort. That’s because we are relying on tacit  knowledge,  which  is  impossible  to\\ndescribe  in  exact  detail. We  possess  that  knowledge,  but  it  resides  in  our\\nsubconscious and muscle memory where language cannot reach. This problem—known as “self-ignorance”—has been a major roadblock in the\\ndevelopment  of  artificial  intelligence  and  other  computer  systems. Because  we\\ncannot  describe  how  we  know  what  we  know,  it  can’t  be  programmed  into\\nsoftware. The curse of computer scientists is our blessing, because this tacit knowledge\\nrepresents  the  final  frontier  on  which  humans  outperform  machines. The  jobs\\nand endeavors that rely on tacit knowledge will be the last ones to be automated. As you build your Second Brain, you will collect many facts and figures, but\\nthey are just a means to an end: discovering the tacit knowledge that lives within\\nyou. It’s  in  there,  but  you  need  external  hooks  to  pull  it  out  and  into  your\\nconscious awareness. If we know more than we can say, then we need a system for\\ncontinuously offloading the vast wealth of knowledge we’ve gained from real life\\nexperience. You  know  things  about  how  the  world  works  that  you  can’t  fully  put  into\\nwords. You understand human nature at a deep intuitive level. You see patterns\\nand connections in your field that no other machine or human can see. Life has\\n\\ngiven you a set of experiences that provide you with a unique lens on the world. Through that lens you can perceive truths that can have a profoundly positive\\nimpact on you and others. We  are  constantly  told  that  we  should  be  true  to  ourselves  and  pursue  our\\ndeepest desires, but what if you don’t know what your goals and desires are? What\\nif  you  have  no  idea  what  your  “life  purpose”  is  or  should  be? Self-direction  is\\nimpossible  without  self-knowledge. How  can  you  know  what  you  want  if  you\\ndon’t know who you are? The process of knowing yourself can seem mystical, but I see it as eminently\\npractical. It starts with noticing what resonates with you. Noticing what seems to\\ncall out to you in the external world and gives you a sense of déjà vu. There is a\\nuniverse  of  thoughts  and  ideas  and  emotions  within  you.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"1718453e-413c-42a5-a905-8eff7680ad75":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"1718453e-413c-42a5-a905-8eff7680ad75\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/home/mw10013/src/remix-sandbox/scripts/basb.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"e8560c36-2aaa-42ed-a41c-cf7d1b7a954c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"87f2dc34-e7bc-4e9b-ad63-adb6f8813114\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"\"}},\"hash\":\"\",\"text\":\"Over  time,  you  can\\nuncover new layers of yourself and new facets of your identity.

Our Fundamental Need for Self-Expression\\nIn Chapter 1, I told the story of my unexplained medical condition and how it led\\nme to start organizing information digitally. There  was  a  period  a  few  years  into  that  journey  when  I  was  at  my  lowest\\npoint. I had seemingly exhausted every avenue that modern medicine could offer\\nme. The  doctors  were  suggesting  that  it  must  be  all  in  my  head  because  their\\ndiagnostics couldn’t find anything wrong. I was in more pain than ever before,\\nwaking up with so much tension in my neck that it felt like a vise clutching me by\\nthe throat. I  started  withdrawing  from  my  friends  and  social  circles  because  I  was  so\\nconsumed by the pain I was experiencing. My attention was so focused on the\\npain in my body that I found it difficult to hold a conversation. I started spending\\nmore and more time by myself, on the Internet, where I could communicate and\\nconnect  without  speech. My  view  of  life  darkened  as  I  slowly  spiraled  into\\ndepression and despair. It felt for a time like I had no future. How could I date or\\n\\nmake friends without being able to speak? What kind of job could I hold down\\nwith unpredictable, chronic pain? What kind of future could I look forward to as\\nmy symptoms continued to worsen, without any treatment or even diagnosis on\\nthe horizon? It was around this time that I made two discoveries that changed, and saved,\\nmy  life. The  first  was  meditation  and  mindfulness. I  began  to  meditate  and\\ndiscovered  a  whole  realm  of  spirituality  and  introspection  that  I  never  knew\\nexisted. I  learned,  to  my  astonishment,  that  I  am  not  my  thoughts. That  my\\nthoughts were the constant background chatter of my subconscious mind, and\\nthat I could choose whether to “believe” what they were telling me. Meditation\\ngave  me  more  relief  from  my  symptoms  than  anything  the  doctors  could\\nprescribe. My pain became my teacher, showing me what needed my attention. As  I  started  having  deep,  profoundly  moving  experiences  in  meditation,  I\\nwanted to share what I was learning with others. This led me to my second great\\ndiscovery: writing in public. II\\n  I  started  a  blog,  and  my  very  first  blog  post  was\\nabout my experience at a Vipassana meditation retreat in Northern California. I\\nstill had trouble speaking, so writing became my refuge. On my blog, I could share\\nanything I wanted to, in as much detail as I wanted. I was in control, with no\\nlimits on my ability to express myself. I  discovered  something  through  that  experience:  that  self-expression  is  a\\nfundamental  human  need. Self-expression  is  as  vital  to  our  survival  as  food  or\\nshelter. We must be able to share the stories of our lives—from the small moments\\nof what happened today at school to our grandest theories of what life is about. Your Turn: The Courage to Share\\nI’ve spoken with so many people about their stories, and I’ve noticed time and\\nagain how many of them have beautiful, moving, powerful things to share. They\\nhave unique experiences that have revealed to them deep wisdom, yet they almost\\nalways undervalue those stories and experiences. They think maybe one day they’ll\\nget around to sharing them. I’m here to tell you that there is no reason to wait. The world is desperate to hear what you know. You can change lives by sharing\\nyourself with others. It takes courage and vulnerability to stand up and deliver your message. It takes\\ngoing against the grain, refusing to be quiet and hidden in the face of fear. Finding\\nyour voice and speaking your truth is a radical act of self-worth: Who are you to\\nspeak up?

It could be someone you’re having coffee with, a client or\\ncustomer, or  your  online  followers. In  those  moments,  the  vast  chasm  that\\nseparates us as humans is bridged. For a brief moment, you get to feel in your\\nbones that we are all in this together.

With the power of a Second Brain behind you, you can do and be anything\\nyou  want. Everything  is  just  information,  and  you  are  a  master  at  flowing  and\\nshaping it toward whatever future you desire. Final Thoughts: You Can Do This\\nThere is no single right way to build a Second Brain. Your system can look like\\nchaos to others, but if it brings you progress and delight, then it’s the right one. You  may  start  with  one  project  and  slowly  move  on  to  more  ambitious  or\\ncomplex ones as your skills develop. Or you may find yourself using your Second\\nBrain in completely unexpected ways that you hadn’t envisioned. As  your  needs  change,  give  yourself  the  freedom  to  discard  or  take  on\\nwhichever parts serve you. This isn’t a “take it or leave it” ideology where you\\nmust  accept  all  of  it  or  none  of  it. If  any  part  doesn’t  make  sense  or  doesn’t\\nresonate with you, put it aside. Mix and match the tools and techniques you’ve\\n\\nlearned in this book to suit your needs. This is how you ensure your Second Brain\\nremains a lifelong companion through the seasons of your life. Wherever you are at this moment—just starting a practice to consistently take\\nnotes,  or  finding  ways  to  more  effectively  organize  and  resurface  your  best\\nthinking, or generating more original and impactful work—you can always fall\\nback on the four steps of CODE:\\nKeep what resonates (Capture)\\nSave for actionability (Organize)\\nFind the essence (Distill)\\nShow your work (Express)\\nIf at any point you feel overwhelmed, take a step back and focus on what is\\nimmediately necessary: your most important projects and priorities. Scale back to\\nonly  the  notes  you  need  to  move  those  priorities  forward. Instead  of  trying  to\\narchitect your entire Second Brain system from scratch up front, focus on moving\\none project at a time through each step from capturing to expressing. When you\\ndo  so,  you’ll  find  that  the  steps  are  much  easier  and  more  flexible  than  you\\nimagined. You can also simplify things by focusing on just one stage of building your\\nSecond Brain. Think about where you are now and where you want to be in the\\nnear future:\\nAre you hoping to remember more?

I’ve  postponed  the  writing  of  these  acknowledgments  for  as  long  as\\npossible  because  it  feels  almost  impossible. The  number  of  people  who  have\\ncontributed to and touched this book along the way is staggering. The depth of\\ngratitude I feel for all the love and energy and intelligence that they have poured\\ninto me is difficult to put into words.

Thank you to Stephanie Hitchcock and the team at Atria for your willingness\\nto take a chance on a novel idea and a first-time author. This book exists only\\nbecause  you  saw  its  potential  and  committed  to  seeing  it  realized. I’m  deeply\\ngrateful to my editor, Janet Goldstein, for wrangling my words (and sometimes\\nme!) into a message far clearer and more elegant than anything I could have come\\nup with on my own. My agent, Lisa DiMona, has graciously guided me through\\nevery step of the publishing journey from the earliest days of this project. I look\\nforward to working together for many years to come. Thank  you  to  the  Forte  Labs  team  and  extended  network—Betheny\\nSwinehart,  Will  Mannon,  Monica  Rysavy,  Marc  Koenig,  Steven  Zen,  Becca\\nOlason, and Julia Saxena. You’ve been behind the scenes every step of the way\\nmaking  the  business  work,  overcoming  challenges,  and  creating  new  ways  of\\nsharing these ideas with the world. I am continuously amazed by your dedication\\nto excellence. You constantly impress me with your deep commitment to creating\\nlasting,  positive  change  in  people’s  lives. I  look  forward  to  everything  we’ll\\naccomplish together. I’m eternally grateful to Billy Broas for helping me find more powerful ways of\\ncommunicating my truth beyond my inner circle. To Maya P. Lim for crafting\\nthe visual identity that will deliver our education to every corner of the planet. And I’m thankful to the Pen Name team for partnering with me in sharing my\\nlife’s work far and wide. The only way my business (or life) functions is with the help of my “brain\\ntrust.” The work I do wouldn’t be half as meaningful or interesting without your\\nunwavering  support. David,  building  a  business  with  you  and  developing  our\\nideas side by side has been one of the most meaningful endeavors of my career. Joel, you are like a rock in stormy seas. I’ve lost count of how many times dinners\\nin your home served as a stabilizing force when it seemed like everything was going\\nto  unravel. Raphael,  you  came  up  with  the  name  of  the  course—and  now  the\\nbook. The laughter you’ve brought into my life has been like a beacon of joy every\\ntime I’ve started to take myself too seriously. Derick, in many ways this journey\\nstarted with our late-night conversations as teenagers about technology and the\\nfuture—ours and humanity’s. Thank you for entertaining and encouraging those\\nfar-fetched ideas, some of which, after all these years, found their way into this\\nbook. I’ve had a series of mentors and advisors who shifted my trajectory in ways I\\ncan hardly believe. Thank you to Venkatesh Rao for serving as my introduction to\\nthe  online  world  of  ideas. A  few  words  of  your  public  support  and\\nencouragement fueled my motivation for years. Thank you to David Allen for\\npioneering the personal productivity field and introducing us to the possibility\\nthat  we  could  proactively  improve  how  we  worked  with  and  managed\\ninformation. I have been profoundly influenced and helped by your ideas. Thank you to Kathy Phelan, not only for believing I was on to something, but\\nfor sponsoring and advising me in bringing my work into companies. Your belief\\nin me at the time outshined my own, and your advice and lessons continue to\\nresound years later. Thank you to James Clear for giving so generously of your\\ntime and guiding my book writing efforts around many pitfalls and blind spots. At a time when everyone in the world wanted your attention, you chose to give it\\nto a fledgling writer with not much to offer in return. Thank you to Joe Hudson,\\nwho came into my life as a friend and mentor at a crucial moment when I needed\\nto learn how to navigate the emotions of the new level of self-expression I was\\ntaking on.

You\\nare the fuel powering all the capturing, organizing, distilling, and expressing that\\n\\nmakes the Building  a  Second  Brain community so vibrant. This book is just as\\nmuch a distillation of the stories, strategies, and techniques I’ve learned from you\\nover the years as it is my own ideas. You are the ultimate authority on what works\\nand  what  doesn’t. By  taking  my  courses,  reading  my  writing,  and  giving  me\\nfeedback on everything from tweets to book drafts, you’ve opened the door to a\\nfuture where Second Brains are available to people everywhere. I never expected so\\nmany people to believe in what I was doing. Every single day I have your support\\nand attention I consider a miracle. Everything I am ultimately comes from my family. My soil and my rock, from\\nwhich the meaning and joy in my life springs. Thank you to my parents, Wayne\\nForte and Valeria Vassão Forte, for giving me an upbringing that exposed me to\\ncountless  enriching  experiences,  cultures,  places,  and  people. Dad,  you  are  my\\nmodel of what it means to express myself with unsparing honesty and taste, while\\nalso upholding my responsibilities as a father, husband, and citizen. Mom, you\\ngave  me  the  gifts  to  balance  out  my  strong  will  and  sharp  tongue—patience,\\ngenerosity,  graciousness,  and  self-awareness. You  both  dedicated  your  lives  to\\nmaking me the kind of person with enough abundance to share with others. So\\nmany  of  the  teachings  expressed  in  this  book  have  their  origin  in  the  simple,\\npractical lessons you taught me and modeled for me as a child. To my siblings and\\nin-laws, Lucas, Paloma, Marco, Kaitlyn, and Grant. You are my best friends, my\\nconfidants, and my lifelong companions. Every time I start to lose sight of who I\\nam and what’s important to me, you bring me back to the soil I came from. I\\ncherish every minute we spend together. And finally, from the bottom of my heart I am thankful to you, Lauren and\\nCaio, for making all this worthwhile. Lauren, you have played every role a person\\ncan play in my life—partner, lover, cofounder, coach, advisor, and now, wife and\\nmother. You became whoever you needed to become, acquired whichever skills\\nwere demanded of you, and ventured into one new territory after another, all to\\nhelp  me  reach  my  dreams. There’s  nothing  more  gratifying  in  my  life  than\\nwatching  you  grow  and  evolve  into  the  most  inspiring,  genuine,  open-hearted\\nperson I’ve ever met. I consider it my highest privilege to walk alongside you as\\nyou step into your greatness. Caio, you’ve only just arrived, but already I can’t live\\nwithout you. You make my life so much more colorful and hilarious. My love for\\n\\nyou gives me the determination to become the best version of myself I can. My\\nhighest hope for this book is that it makes the world a safer, more humane, and\\nmore interesting place for you.
